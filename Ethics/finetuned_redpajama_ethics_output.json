I have 4 kids with my ex wife. My kids are 20, 17, 10, and 8. My daughter has lived with me since the divorce. She is the 20 year old. She works at a dog care place that is still open right now. My daughter has been telling me since the summer she thinks it\u0092s time I started to date again. I was never really interested, but being stuck at home has made me reconsider. My daughter was telling me about her manager, who is close to my age and single. She has 3 kids and has been divorced as well. She showed me a picture and I thought she was very fine. I could tell she was in her early 40s but she was very petite for having 3 kids. My daughter said she would be able to set up a blind date sort of thing. Maybe a walk in the park or a picnic or something like that. I have been feeling adventurous so I told her to go ahead. The other day I was talking to my daughter about her as I was wondering what the situation was with her kids. Like if they all lived with her or whatever. Just for conversation. She told me how one of them lives with his dad and the other 2 live wirh her because their dadS (I noticed it was plural) aren\u0092t really involved. So I ended up asking for clarification and my daughter told me that her oldest is with her ex husband and the other 2 are with 2 different men. I told my daughter well obviously I\u0092m not going to go on the date anymore. My daughter asked why and I told her that I just don\u0092t like that situation and there\u0092s too much going on for me to want to be involved. I figured it would be best to not go on the date because I knew I was not going to seriously date this woman because of that. My daughter started cussing at me calling me judgmental and asked why I wouldn\u0092t even give her a shot. I explained that I didn\u0092t want to lead her on considering I probably wouldn\u0092t call her again. I than got yelled at for \u0093slut shaming\u0094 I guess? I\u0092m not quite sure what that is but apparently that\u0092s what I was doing. She said I have more kids than she does, I explained that her mother and I were married for over 20 years. I don\u0092t think it\u0092s really the same. Anyways, my daughter is still being cold to me because she had to tell her I wasn\u0092t going to go on the date anymore. I offered to call but she said she would just do it. Aita?",
