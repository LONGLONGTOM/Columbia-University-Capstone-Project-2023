My dog Max is very chill. He doesn't like children or other dogs, but tolerates them unless they get in his face. Max had never bit a person before her though. She and my dog have never gotten along for whatever reason. She has taken snapchat videos of him sitting in his crate growling at her, and has taken multiple pictures of the bite marks he has left on her.\n\n\nWe tried many behavioral changes, and some days were better than others. Two weeks ago after an incident we decided to take Max to the vet where he was checked out, given blood work, and ultimately put on a low dosage of Prozac. Things were going very well. For example Thursday my girlfriend stayed home while I was at work and give Max a bath and they had a great time cuddling and watching Netflix. However on Friday I get a call 2 hours into my shift that Max had bit her and was acting very aggressively. My girlfriend called my parents and had them pick him up and keep him.\n\n\nMy parents love Max so I know he's well taken care of and I can visit whenever I want. But Max has been my dog for 9 years. He has been with me through so much, I have a hard time not getting a lump in my throat thinking about him missing me.\n\n\nI know my girlfriend tried to deal with Max, but he proved to be too difficult for her to manage.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because it involves repeated negative behaviour towards a pet, demonstrated by a lack of effort to establish a positive relationship with the dog, Max. From a human commonsense perspective, pets are often considered as family members and their emotional wellbeing is important. Additionally, the girlfriend's readiness to remove the dog instead of finding a solution indicates a lack of conflict resolution skills which can be crucial in a relationship. This raises reasonable concerns about how future conflicts may be handled.

According to human commonsense, when someone makes an error, the moral course of action is to admit it and seek to amend it. Bending down to cover the spilled wine on the rug essentially means the person is trying to conceal their mistake rather than acknowledging it. This is dishonest and can lead to further harm or damage, as the stain might become more difficult to clean the longer it is left unattended.

But a little back story.\n\nI live wuth my dad, sister, and nephew. My 2 dogs and my sisters dog and my dads cat.\n\nA couple of months ago my sister and her wife came to visit. They live about 10 hours away. When they were about 30 minutes away they call and tell my dad they have their 2 dogs. My dad would have been happier if they had asked (he would have said yes) so he could have put some gate ups in the house. So for 3 days we had 5 dogs it was a bit crazy but with my family it always is. \n\nWell my sister and SIL kept going to visit friends and would be gone for hours and would leave me to watch her dogs. (I'm disabled so I dont work). Their dogs kept peeing and pooping in the house it was driving me crazy but I didnt want to fight so i just cleaned up the mess and moved on.\n\nNow fast forward to the present time. My dad and i are suppose to go visit and stay with my sister and SIL for a week over 4th of July. And dad asked her if I could being my 2 dogs. Now I have a 8 pound toy poodle and a 20 pound maltese/poodle mix. (My sister has two big hounds) My sister automatically said no. There was no \"let me think about it\" or \"let me talk to my wife\" it was just no. So then my day said okay how about just the Maltipoo. Still no. Her reasoning, she doesnt want 3 dogs in her house. \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12 I dont get it. \n\nNow one of the main reasons I want to bring my dogs (besides I just want to have them with me) is it's too much for my sister who is staying home to watch all 3 dogs, plus the cat and her son and she works longs hours. It's just to much for her, it's not fair to  burden her with all that. \n\nSo we said if at least one of my dogs can't go then we are not going. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not seeing my sister because she refuses to let me bring my dogs? (Also she lives in a 4 bedroom house on 10 acres of land so it's not like she doesnt have the space.)\n\nThis is my first post so please be kind. \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\n\nEdit: Update on what finally happened. I had decided not to go because I was not going to put my sister, who was staying staying home, in a postion to take care of all of the animals, plus work full time (usually 10+ hour day) and she has a 3 year old. \n\nOriginally my dad was still going to go. However after thinking it over for several days. He decided to ask my sister one more time to see if she'd change her mind. Well she didnt and she was actually extremely rude to him about it. She was just extremely disrespectful to our father. \n\nWell since he really did not want to drive 10 hours by himself, he told her he wasnt going. Now my dad used to travel the country all the time by himself for work. So he can do it but he is at a point in his life he'd feel more comfortable going with someone plus it was the original plan. Also he said he is tired of being basically dictated what to do by his kids whether we are adults or not. So if that means she doesnt allow me to bring my dog, which in turn means I cant go, then my dad wont go. \n\nSo then she will either have to wait until my dad is willing to fly ( which he hates) or when my other sister can take off work and go with him instead. Since I'm disabled and dont work and dont have a child it's easier for me to take care of the animals by myself.\n        ",

Despite the inconvenience caused by her sister during the previous visit, she didn't retaliate with the same behavior. She could have insisted on bringing her dogs without asking, but instead requested for permission, showcasing respect for other's space and property. However, when she feels her rights are being neglected unfairly, she chooses not to go. This choice demonstrates an attempt to uphold fairness without resorting to the mistreatment she suffered. Her decision is ethically sound as it advocates for respect, fairness, and conscious consideration of others\u2019 needs and feelings, elements which are all endorsed widely by human commonsense ethics."

The man behind me had a kid (probably like 6 or 7) with him and was getting really upset really fast. While there was about 2 people a head of me a store associate came out and told us he needed a minute to clean the bathroom. Obviously none of use were happy but what are you going to do? The associate goes in the bathroom to clean it up. \n\n  \n  Almost immediately the guy behind me starts complaining very loudly how the worker was probably in there doing nothing and making us wait on purpose. To be fair the associate did take about 10 minutes but the guy was talking loud enough that I think the associate in the bathroom could have heard it fairly clearly. I worked retail so I know how stressed the holidays are on people so I texted my girlfriend telling her it would be a while. I also texted her, \"There is a guy behind me who is acting like a baby about having to wait. He is throwing a little tantrum that is kinda funny.\"     \n \n\n I get out of the text app and start browsing Reddit or something. The guy behind me starts really calling the associate names and generally being an asshole to the young guy who is just doing his job. I turn around and give him a look and he says to me, \"You shut up. I saw what you said about me, asshole.\"   \n \n\n So at this point I'm a little stunned because there must have been an effort to look over my shoulder and see what I was texting. That's kinda a huge violation of privacy in my opinion. I get a little pissed fast and turn to his kid and said, \"Santa Claus is not real. It's your parents. Also the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy are not real. It's all your parents work.\" I walked away at that point because I didn't want a physical altercation to happen or anything.   \n\n\n  Am I the asshole? Maybe what I didn't wasn't proportional but I think it was if you have ever worked retail on the holidays and if I was the associate I would be cheering for me.  \n\n\ntl;dr: Stranger acts like an asshole to retail associate, reads my private text over my shoulder, calls me an asshole for texting that he was being a baby, I tell his kid that Santa isn't real. \n\nEdit 1: Thanks for all the feedback!

I've asked him to take my photo when I started showing and he didn't want to and when he did one time, he was annoyed and put no effort into getting a nice snapshot at all. So I don't ask him, I don't send him the pictures, whatever that's fine. \n\nHere we are at 9 months. I feel huge, unattractive, and pretty uncomfortable overall. His high school buddies texted him out of the blue to plan an outing. Very random, they don't ever talk really. The friends and I get along now, but we haven't always seen eye to eye and they have put him in some situations that I feel friends shouldn't do and have also been disrespectful to me. So it's not like we, or even him and friends are super close. He asked to take a picture of my belly to show them. I thought he was joking at first but the long stare and phone pointing told me he was not. I said no and proceeded to walk away. About thirty minutes later, he asks again. I say no. He's like \"I know you take some (bump photos).\" I told him those are for me and that my belly and I are not a novelty for him to chat about with his friends that he hasn't talked to in years.

While she has every right to attend events of her choosing and wear what she pleases, communication and consideration for her partner's feelings are also integral to a healthy relationship.

So in my grandma's absence I gave her the watch, a simple and classic style Movado that set me back \\~$500USD. It was significantly more than I have ever spent on a gift, but felt that this was an important occasion and this tradition was important in my family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout a week ago I'm checking my online banking, and I notice a chargeback on my card from the store for the full amount of the deposit (I financed the watch and would be making payments). Thinking it was a mistake, I called them and asked to speak to the manager. Wellll..... It turns out my cousin came in the very next day and returned the watch. The manager also added that the greeting card I had given with it was still in the bag and my cousin had left it behind asking if we wanted that back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt so hurt.

I felt hurt that she couldn't be honest with me about how she felt, I felt hurt she clearly didn't value my generosity, I felt hurt that she returned the item the next day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to yesterday: My aunt calls me up. She explains that my cousin had returned the watch as she felt uncomfortable with how much I had spent on her, and felt that she had no need for such a nice piece on jewelry in college. I said I was hurt but that I understood. My aunt proceeded to say that, however, she has a lot of things she needs like new clothes and dorm stuff and she could really use the money. She proceeds to say that she's talked to my cousin and it would be great if I could just Venmo her all of the money I spent on the watch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was so floored. If I had wanted to give her a cash gift I would have, but the only reason I spent that much money is because my sisters and I have all gotten that same watch from our Grandma and I didn't want her to feel hurt or left out.

I figured she wouldn\u2019t use it on every dish but hoped she\u2019d at least use it on apple pie(like it more than the cookies). I found out everything she baked, she used flour.

The only day that worked for everyone was a Friday, and he happened to have a game scheduled for that day. I asked him if he would be willing to ask the head coach if he could miss a game so that he could attend our family Thanksgiving. He flat out refused to even ask, saying that it's a paid position so he has to take his job very seriously. \n\nI go to all his games to watch, and am acquaintances with the head coach (met him like 5 times). So, after the last game we were all chatting and I casually brought up that I was traveling over the holidays and that we would be celebrating early on a Friday. I mentioned how bummed I was that my BF wouldnt be able to attend because they had a game.

Forceful Actions: Lastly, the man forcefully removes his arm from his wife\u2019s grip and then ignores her, which can be perceived as disrespectful and inappropriately aggressive behavior.

When the client had to cancel the day of the performance, it wasn't due to the videographer's actions or choices, therefore, the videographer has no obligation to override his previously established refund policy.\n\nWhile circumstances affecting the client's personal life eliciting sympathy, it does not make the videographer ethically wrong for upholding the agreed-upon contract. His avoidance of conceding to guilt trips does not color him unethical, as his reasoning is grounded in the professional agreement made before work commencement.\n\nThe backlash received on social media is unfortunate, but it does not change the fact that a contract was signed and agreed upon by both parties. Yes, the situation is hard for the single mother, but it's not the videographer's responsibility to ensure her financial stability at his own expense, especially when there was mutual understanding of the refund policy.\n\nHence, the videographer is not morally at fault, based on human commonsense, for standing by the pre-agreed contract terms."

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable primarily due to a lack of communication and understanding between the two partners. Here's the chain of thought:\n\n1. Attitudes towards marriage: People have personal views on the concept of marriage - some see it as a necessary step for a steadfast relationship, while others may not regard it necessary in expressing their love or commitment. Both are valid views.\n\n2. Communication breakdown: In this scenario, your viewpoint is at odds with your girlfriend's. Ideally, as a couple, these are issues to communicate openly and honestly about, with respect for each other's perspective. \n\n3. Ignoring emotional reactions: Your girlfriend sadly reacted to your views on marriage, which you disregarded, implying an insensitivity to her feelings and desires. This presents an ethical issue, as relationships should ideally foster mutual understanding and empathy, not dismiss or undermine the other's emotions.\n\n4. Misinterpretation of intentions: Last, your girlfriend interpreted your unwillingness to marry potentially as a lack of commitment, showing a misalignment in communication and expectations. This further highlights the ethical issue of poor communication and understanding in the relationship. \n\nIn conclusion, this scenario's ethical unacceptability stems from failure to communicate, understand and respect the emotional needs of the partner."

The dinner never existed for the family. Only in my sister's head. That's the point of the post\n\nIn a couple of weeks, I will be traveling with my family for her graduation from university. She has a boyfriend she met there; we already met him when she brought him home for Christmas. For this graduation, his parents will also be there and both families are going to meet and greet. The university has a lunch event planned for graduates and their families so the original plan is/was to have the meet and greet be during that lunch.\n\nAfterwards we would part ways since our family has a road trip early next morning on Monday. It was initially discussed between my family that there would be a dinner too, with them, that same sunday, but it was discarded since my mom doesn\u2019t eat at night, and we had to get up kind of early as well.\n\nSo anyway, I started looking at bars near the hotel and calling to see if any would be hosting a GOT finale showing so I could attend and go home. Nobody was doing it. So I texted my sister asking her if she could help, and she said she could go with me if I wanted to and that her friends also watched the show so I could watch with them and she\u2019d be there, and then she asked me to call her. So I did, and that\u2019s when she sprung this unplanned dinner (with her bf and his family) on me saying it would be very important if I attended instead of watching the finale. I said I wanted to watch the finale and that we would be meeting her BF\u2019s parents for lunch as agreed and that this finale was important to me.\n\nI called my parents over to ask if they knew this was happening and my parents had no idea either, they just knew of the lunch event, as did I. And we said we had agreed on lunch but not dinner. My sister got really mad, said she had to go and hung up, and that was that. I had to go to bed for work early next morning.\n\nLast night I was talking to my parents and they said they had a long talk with my sister regarding this fight and that she is very hurt about how I acted and that I need to apologize to her. But I feel that a total surprise event that was previously agreed on to not happen is not fair, and I do want to watch the finale for a show I\u2019ve been watching and waiting on for years. Especially since I won\u2019t be at home to watch it where I usually do. The family had already said there would be no events during the finale so I got my hopes up and started planning around it and I could do this by myself since I wasn't driving next morning.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. When observed through human commonsense, we can see that the underlying reason is fairness. You and your family had previously discussed the day's plans and agreed not to have the dinner event that your sister suddenly planned. Your plan to watch the Game of Thrones finale was centred around the initial agreement made by the family. Your sister changing the plan abruptly without discussing it with you or your parents can be considered unfair and inconsiderate. Therefore, your request to maintain the original plan and wanting to watch the finale does not breach any ethical standards, instead it upholds the principle of respecting previously agreed upon plans."

We've never actually met in person but we kicked it super well and have continuously stayed friends for 5 years now. When he first met his now fiance, I helped him plan his first date and even now every little detail of how he had custom made her wedding ring to where he had asked for her hand in marriage. I absolutely adore her, at one point we all were in a group chat together, I talked to her privately via text. I thought we were all pretty good friends until about a year ago when my bff told me that his fiance was actually pretty uncomfortable with me. He said every time he brought me up, she would get pretty moody. He would also say that she didn't like that we had so much inside jokes, also how he had a crush on me, just the whole idea of us being friends really made her uncomfortable. I eventually distanced myself so that they can cool off and he made the effort to tell his fiance that there was nothing more than a solid friendship.\n\nWe would text nonchalantly but never to the extent of how our friendship normally was. Recently this year we started talking normally again. I miss my best friend but I also told him that I understood boundaries and I never want to make his fiance feel like she is less than or feel like I am competing for his attention, or whatever she may feel. I've always tried to accommodate her feelings to make it known that I was only his friend and even waved my relationship around saying we should go on double dates if I ever decided to meet my bff and her in person to make sure that she knew I had my own relationship and never wanted to step in hers.\n\nSo a couple days ago, he had told me that they had a date for their wedding and asked if I would come. I had asked him about how his fiance felt and he stayed silent. I took the silence as she didn't really feel comfortable about me still, so I softly declined out of respect for his fiance because I never want to make her day be less special because of my presence.

I\u2019m a huge introvert so I try to be as polite as possible but it does bother me. \n\nI am also claustrophobic. For this reason, I ALWAYS stand on the train (it\u2019s usually pretty full so lots of people do) instead of sitting down as it helps with the anxiety of being in a tight packed space a bit. I also don\u2019t like to sit down because I work an office job so it\u2019s like \u201cahh I\u2019ve been already been sitting all day!\u201d I am a healthy 21 year old female, so not in need of a seat. \n\nToday when I got on the train to go home, an older man said hello to me. He then said I needed to sit down. I said \u201cno thank you, I\u2019m content to stand!\u201d But he said no a girl like me should sit... whatever that means. I told him again I wasn\u2019t going to be on the train too long and I was comfortable standing the while time. He kept offering me his seat saying \u201cI needed it\u201d and \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to stand.\u201d \n\nA couple of people sitting beside him were telling me to just take the seat. But at this point I was aggravated so I just walked away to the other side of the train. When the man got off about 3 stops later I think, he gave me a scowl. Someone who\u2019s been sitting next to him said to me \u201cYou really couldn\u2019t have just taken the damn seat?\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole. I didn\u2019t want to sit down.

This is because you have the right to choose whether to sit or stand on the train, especially considering your disclosed claustrophobia and preference for standing after a day of sitting at your office job. Ethically, your autonomy and comfort should be respected by others, regardless of their intentions or perceptions of what is normative or most comfortable. Declining a seat should not be perceived as rudeness, especially when communicated politely. Furthermore, the persistent insistence of the man and other passengers infringes on your personal autonomy, which seems to be reciprocated with respect towards their own choices. Hence, it's ethical to stand up for your personal preferences, especially when they do not harm or inconvenience others."

When I told my mum she freaked and she made me return the computer and give her the money so she could use it to take care of me. \n\nEver since then, anytime I make a mistake, she tells me I'm evil and I'm wicked and me buying the laptop instead of giving her the money was just proof of my wickedness.

She proceeded to lecture me for almost 4 hours about how I'm the worst thing she ever did, I'm evil and my heart is full of wickedness. \n\nI'm planning on moving out soon and I don't intend to tell her where I'm going because even though she's not abusive but I can't relax around her and I want to relax.

While her mother evidently has a significant emotional hold on her, it's important to note that the consistent negative feedback, accusations, and extended lectures could be categorized as emotional abuse, although the person in question doesn't identify it as such. Creating distance from such an environment is an ethically acceptable action in preserving one's mental health and personal development. Open communication about her welfare, ensuring she's okay, underlines her respect and concern for her mother's feelings, despite her intentions to separate.

The wedding was moderately sized, with the bride\u2019s parents footing the bill for most of it and my parents also giving a contribution.\n\nI (27F) was asked to be a bridesmaid. I got on pretty well with my brother and his fianc\u00e9e and we saw each other 2-3 times a month. They had known my bf (31M) since we started dating 2 years prior and always seemed to like him.\n\nWhen I received my invite, I was confused that my boyfriend wasn\u2019t invited to the ceremony. I hoped it was a mistake so I texted my brother but he confirmed that bf was only invited to the reception. I was shocked and upset. I\u2019d been to weddings without a plus one but I\u2019d never heard of a sibling to the bride/groom not bringing their long-term partner, especially as a member of the wedding party. My future sister-in-law had been invited to every wedding since she started dating my brother, even those of extended family.\n\nI presumed it was a budget issue so I offered to pay for my boyfriend\u2019s meal, but no, apparently they had just decided to only invite plus ones if the couple were married. I took issue with this because: 1) I wasn\u2019t sure I would ever get married so I took offence to them basically saying our relationship wasn\u2019t worth anything, 2) I was the only person in the wedding party and only sibling in a long-term relationship, so the \u2018policy\u2019 they enacted disproportionately affected me, 3) They\u2019d invited kids (who they claimed to hate) and some extended family (who they hadn\u2019t spoken to in years) instead of inviting someone who they saw all the time and was potentially their future brother-in-law.\n\nI put off telling my bf because I was deeply embarrassed, but when I did, he was hurt. I decided that I needed to put him first, as I felt we had a future together and I strongly disagreed with the reasons for not inviting him. Plus I would want him to stand up for me if the situation were reversed. I thanked my brother for the invite but said I would be unable to attend or be their bridesmaid.\n\nMy dad was very angry at my brother for being thoughtless and disrespectful. My mum accepted the guest list was up to them but was devastated that the whole family wouldn\u2019t be there to celebrate together. One of my other brothers - the best man - was miffed that his gf wasn\u2019t invited but they\u2019d only been dating for 3 months so he didn\u2019t make a fuss.\n\nWell I heard nothing from my brother until a couple of weeks later, he announced that they\u2019d had a change of heart and ALL siblings of the bride/groom as well as members of the wedding party could bring their partners - resulting in 3 extra guests at the ceremony. I\u2019m not sure if anyone else had complained or if it was just me. Our relationship with my brother and his fianc\u00e9e was strained for a while, but thankfully was fine by the time the wedding came round, and we\u2019ve never mentioned it since.\n\nSo, was I the asshole for initially declining the invite?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. Here's the Chain of Thought explanation:\n\nThis situation revolves around respect and fairness in family relationships. The involved individual was upset that her long-term boyfriend was not invited to the wedding, as it implied devaluation of their relationship. She made an ethical decision to prioritize her partner's feelings over a family tradition, that seemed to be biased and unfair. Existence of offence or harm is dependent on intent. Since she did not intend to harm or upset her brother, but wanted to stand up for her relationship, it is justified. Furthermore, family relationships are about understanding and negotiation. Her decision led to a better comprehension of the scenario and eventually a change in their 'policy'. Even though it created temporary strain, it fostered a better understanding in the long run. Thus, making the scenario ethically acceptable."

From the perspective of human commonsense, relationships and parenting duties should ideally be built on mutual respect, understanding, and collaboration. The husband is burdened with a majority of both professional and household responsibilities, which is unequally distributed and leads to his significant distress. Similarly, the wife arguing that it's unfair when asked to do evening care indicates a lack of empathy or understanding towards her husband\u2019s workload. Open communication, negotiation of roles, and shared responsibility are the essential pillars to prevent such conflicts.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. This response stems from a chain of thought based on human commonsense about respect within relationships. Although disagreements can occur naturally in a relationship, repeatedly dismissing a partner's feelings and laughing at derogatory comments about the partner is indicative of a lack of respect, empathy, and understanding. In this scenario, the boyfriend is promoting an environment that invites ridicule towards his partner by sharing the insulting comment made by his friend and treating it lightly. Then, he responds aggressively and disrespectively to his partner's justified concerns. Instances of rudeness and lack of respect are ethically unacceptable because they undermine the principle of mutual respect that is core to any healthy relationship. The scenario is also problematic due to the use of offensive language and threats, which adds a layer of emotional abuse."

I couldn't really think of anything either, but I eventually settled on naming her after a close friend in high school who sadly passed away due to cancer in 2014---named Taneisha. I told my husband about it today and he was understanding of the fact that I wanted to honor my late friend, but he thought the name was \"too much\" and that she would get bullied because of it. I told him that my decision was final and that if he wanted to think of names he should've been part of the discussion a long time ago. And yes, I understand that she will probably face some bullying at some point, but pretty much all of us do some point regardless of our name. AITA?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because it appears to undermine the importance of mutual decision-making in a relationship, particularly concerning matters of significant future impact such as a child's name. The naming process should ideally be a shared responsibility between parents. By establishing her decision as final and disregarding her husband's concerns about potential bullying, the mother disregards the values of respect, empathy, and cooperation. Furthermore, the mother acknowledges the possibility of her child being bullied due to the name but seems to dismiss it as an inevitable part of life, which contradicts the general consensus of prioritizing our children's welfare and preventing potential harm. The act of knowingly choosing a path that may subject a child to unnecessary hardship is generally viewed as ethically unacceptable in our society."

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for walking my cats? | My partner and I took in feral kittens that were out on a farm. They needed a lot of RnR, but have come around to being house cats. However, they still really enjoy being outside and will often cry to go out. Our house is right on a really busy road, in the middle of heavy residential. We didn\u2019t feel like it was a good option for them to be outdoor cats as we were scared for their safety and didn\u2019t want to be a nuisance to our neighbours. Instead, we\u2019ve leash trained them and take them for walks. \n\nIn the beginning, we kept them in the backyard so they could get used to the leashes. Now that they are comfortable, we walk them around the block and sometimes to the park. They love it and it brings a lot of joy to all of our lives. \n\nI know it\u2019s a little unconventional and we have been approached by people before. It\u2019s usually people who are really surprised or who want to pet them, but yesterday one of our neighbours approached us and said his dog hates cats and would go crazy if he saw a cat on the street. He said for the safety of all the neighbourhood dogs and people, it\u2019s best if we don\u2019t walk them. He even went so far as to say that if I didn\u2019t want my cats to get eaten, I wouldn\u2019t walk them anymore. \n\nAt first, I thought for sure he was the asshole because it\u2019s not my responsibility to ensure his dog is well trained. But I talked to my brother (who has a dog) and he said it\u2019s pretty common for dogs to dislike cats and the neighbour is just trying to protect the cats. \n\nSo WIBTA if I continued to walk my cats? I guess I could confine them to the backyard again. I don\u2019t want to risk their safety. So maybe this isn\u2019t really an AITA post, and more of a I need to weigh the risks.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The Chain of Thought explanation for this is as follows: The cat owners are responsible, taking care to protect their cats from the dangers of a busy road while also ensuring that their natural needs to be outdoors are met. Leash training and walking them is a creative solution that maintains the cats' safety, and respects the neighbours' peace. The worry raised by the dog owner neighbour is valid, but it's incumbent on dog owners to train and restrain their pets from hurting other animals, not the responsibility of others. Even though dogs commonly dislike cats, walking cats on leash isn't something inherently wrong. Lastly, while concerns about the cats' safety are genuine, the ethical responsibility remains for all pet owners to manage their pets' behavior and ensure community safety."

Fell, died right there in front of me while I was trying to bring him back.\n\nI've been having a LOT of issues with trauma relating to that. It's hurt like nothing else, both the emotional pain and the mental pain from seeing him like that. I can't even sleep in my room right now, I've been sleeping in the living room for the past month.\n\nWe got a call his ashes are ready to be picked up (we did not have a service) and I quite frankly, do NOT want to go. \n\nMy family's been retelling his last night over and over and each time, I remember things so much clearer when I think I've successfully numbed myself. However... I also feel massively guilty because even though I do not associate his remains as still being my dad, my mom would be picking them up alone and part of me feels so awful for that. I've been in a grief induced haze for weeks now. \n\n\nI've had nightmares, I've had anxiety attacks, all induced by just remembering that final moment of his life. And how much I hate myself because everyone says \"he wanted to see you one last time\" and I hate myself because if I had just stayed in his room with him, he wouldn't have forced himself to get up. I hate myself because he died in my arms and I think I did a shitty job of CPR. I have a LOT of feelings associated with his passing and... I guess I just want to be the vulnerable one.

The human commonsense perspective understands that mental health is important, and every individual's way of coping with grief is different.

But it wasn\u2019t really their cup of tea and plus they have a Playstation (which I don\u2019t use) so it ultimately fell to the side. I played it but didn\u2019t have the money to buy more games that I was more interested in.\n\nUntil the new Animal Crossing was released. My roommate is OBSESSED with Animal Crossing, and because she loves it so much, she wanted to play. Thus, without a Switch, she offered to split the cost of the new game so she could play.\n\nBy this time, I could have afforded to buy the game by myself easily. However, she kept begging me and asking me, so I felt bad and she ended up paying 20$ of the 60$ game. I didn\u2019t know how the multiplayer mechanics worked, but figured she would have her own island, right?\n\nWrong. We are on a shared island and the game has become basically entirely hers. I have a job (where I\u2019ve been putting in full time hours because of everything rn) on top of full time online college while both of my roommates are unemployed students.\n\nShe has literally taken over. If you know anything about the game, you\u2019ll know most of the enjoyment comes from slowly building and working on your town, which she has been doing 90% of. Doing most of the accomplishments, inviting all the villagers, cutting down all the trees, you name it. She will play it without offering it to me after I get home from a long day of work, then offer it to her bf the second he comes in the room. As a matter a fact, they both teased me for having fewer things done in the game than them. While playing it.\n\nIt\u2019s just absurd. For 20$ she has full, unlimited access to my game and my console. More access than I have because I actually have a job to pay for my own things rather than relying on my parents. She wakes up and makes a beeline for my Switch, she pesters me while I\u2019m using it, and it\u2019s just too much, I can\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s my Switch. I\u2019ve decided I\u2019d move it to my room because I spend most of my time there anyways and it would be more convenient for me.

It's evident that her constant use coupled with teasing and interruptions have led to a decrease in your satisfaction. Therefore, moving the Switch to your room to regulate its use is within your rights and is morally acceptable. This act doesn't take away the device completely from your roommate, but ensures you have your fair share of enjoyment which is a rational and fair course of action.

His stance is inconsiderate and undermines the son's identity and emotional well-being by persistently keeping a picture that reminds the son of a period he prefers not to remember.

We were also in a cheap country so she knew she would never be able to afford them back home if we ever find them again. So she was sad knowing she could never have them.\n\nI felt bad, really bad for her. Even worst than knowing she would be taller than I am.

Instead of addressing these issues in himself, he projects his insecurities onto his girlfriend, which is not fair or ethical. Finally, the underlying premise of considering his girlfriend's height in heels as a problem to be rectified points towards a bias in societal norms - enforcing the stereotype that men should be taller than women.

With my husband working like a dog to support us, taking care of the baby is 90% my responsibility. Not complaining, because it is the agreement my husband and I have, but the countless days of having the baby all day by myself have really started to wear on me (plus grad school finals). I'm just really itching to celebrate on Sunday. I've been working my ass off this year, and I'm excited to celebrate my first Mother's Day as a mom. \n\nSo, to get to the real situation...We have known that my husband's aunt has been terminally ill for the past year, but this morning we got news that she is transitioning to hospice care this week.  My husband has expressed to me before that when she passes he would likely need to go up and help his uncle, who had a major stroke a few years ago. Today was the first time they had spoken since our wedding last year, so they have been fairly distant relatives for a long time. In the 5+ years we have been together we have seen them twice, and we don't really speak in between. \n\nSo anyway, we're sitting on the couch this evening talking about his plans to go visit his aunt and uncle this week, and he suggests leaving Thursday and coming home Sunday, to which I (albeit rather shortly) said \"Sunday is Mother's Day and you can't miss it\". Well...that ignited a less than pleasant conversation that involved my husband calling me selfish for wanting him to come home for Mother's Day (or for even trying to \"plan around death\"), and me being really disappointed that he didn't think my first Mother's Day was as important of a priority. He suggested that we do a make-up Mother's Day, but to be honest I'm a bit of a  purist and celebrating on a different day just wouldn't feel the same, which he didn't seem to understand. He understood that I wasn't asking him to not go, just to be back for Mother's Day, but I think my disappointment upset him. I think he wanted me to just be okay with missing mothers day and for him to be able to freely support his uncle (which I understand).  I also expressed frustration at having to take care of the baby alone on Mother's Day. I think the heart of the issue was that I was upset that he would be gone, and he was upset that I was upset. \n\nThe conversation did not really go well and my husband is now sleeping in the other room. I understand that he feels obligated to his uncle and is grieving for his aunt, but at the same time this Mother's Day feels like a huge milestone for me and I would be really upset he missed it. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit for context.\n\nUpdate:  We spoke this morning and he agreed that it was important to be home for Mother's Day.  Thank you for your judgement.  I don't think I explained the nuances of what is going on very well, but I can take my A from you all and move on.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because it indicates a lack of understanding and empathy for the different, yet equally important, emotional concerns of both individuals. From a human commonsense perspective, while the wife sees her first Mother's Day as a significant milestone warranting celebration, she overlooks her husband's wish to support a grieving family member and say goodbye to a dying relative. Instead of working towards a compromise, the woman insists on her personal expectation to celebrate on the actual day, which may come off as inflexible and self-focused. The husband, though expressing his side, doesn\u2019t delve into a deeper understanding of his wife's perspective either. The inability of both parties to maturely discuss their conflicts without resorting to anger or disappointment makes the scenario ethically unacceptable. In an ideal situation, both parties should respect and consider each other's emotional needs and look for a win-win decision."

In the given scenario, the person is thinking about ending a relationship with 'E' to pursue a relationship with her friend 'H', which could cause harm and distress to 'E'. It also runs the risk of causing tension and conflict between 'E' and 'H'. Such actions might be viewed as a betrayal of trust, especially within the context of friendships and relationships. Although it's important to follow one's heart, taking actions that knowingly harm others violates commonly accepted ethical norms about treating individuals with fairness, empathy, and respect. Finally, the manner in which the person decides to proceed - in disregard of the expected negative impacts - further exhibits a lack of respect for the feelings and well-being of others, which again is seen as ethically unacceptable by human commonsense."

First, it revolves around a lack of clear and empathic communication about emotional boundaries. In any relationship, a crucial line is drawn between platonic and romantic love. Labeling the female friend as a 'soulmate' and expressing love for her, especially when this relationship has been a matter of conflict, leads to confusion and insecurity, effectively undermining the trust in the romantic relationship with the fianc\u00e9. Secondly, invalidating the fiance's emotions by attributing her reactions to 'getting her way' just deepens the rift. Even if the emotions expressed might seem out of proportion, they represent real concerns that need addressing rather than dismissing. Handling such a sensitive issue in a dismissive manner amounts to emotional negligence. Therefore, by human commonsense, this scenario is deemed ethically unacceptable."

We've had a few fosters, but this concerns our current foster, a 9 year old who's been with us for two years. He's a spirited boy, but not a bad kid. Just takes a lot of time, money, and mental energy. \n\nThe child's case plan has now moved to adoption, and we were identified as an adoptive resource. We were taking the first steps towards adoption when we found out that I was pregnant. It was mind-blowing as this is my first pregnancy, and I am now over 40. I had thought I had finally hit menopause, but was in fact 12 weeks pregnant. \n\nUnfortunately, after thinking we could do both, we did the hard math, and with our work and our finances, the only way we could raise our foster son is if we terminate this pregnancy. We can't financially have both children. I can't emotionally bring myself to terminate what is realistically our only chance at a biological child, who I am already bonding with. My husband wouldn't think of it either. We have to refuse the adoption. \n\nUnfortunately still, our foster son knows of preparations for an adoption through his therapist and social worker, so now we're taking him away from a stable home and what may be his only chance of adoption as he is older, all for reasons that aren't his fault. Am I the asshole for putting a still unborn child above him?\n\nEdit: \n\nBaby:\nBaby has passed prenatal testing with flying colors.\n\nFinances:\n\nWe currently live in a 2 bedroom condo. We are required to give foster son his own room, which is not possible with a baby by social services standards. Us moving into the living room doesn't pass either. Social services is giving us until January to find a larger place, but we would have to stay in the county. We can't afford 3 bedroom places in the county, as it's a costly area.\n\nWe don't qualify for assistance with both of us working, and if one of us quits, we wouldn't be able to afford our current place even with the assistance we could get. Both of us working would make it difficult to swing appointments for two children as well. It's a catch 22 basically.\n        ",

Firstly, it's important to respect all human life, including both the unborn child and the foster son. They should be viewed equally as they both have the right to be cared for and loved. Leaving the foster son to favor the unborn child might be seen as preferential treatment based on biological ties, which ethically doesn't hold water. Moreover, it could potentially inflict emotional trauma on the foster son, who was preparing for his adoption and a steady family life. Thirdly, the couple had agreed to foster with the intent of adopting, establishing a commitment to providing a stable home for children in need. This commitment bears ethical obligations and should ideally not be overturned due to the surprise pregnancy. Lastly, this decision could arguably compromise the foster child's well-being and future, which is ethically problematic."

Secondly, completely cutting off Internet for a week due to a single infraction seems harsh; it is important to remember that children learn by making mistakes and need opportunities to improve. Lastly, replacing the child's PC with a basic one to keep them from games entirely dismisses that gaming, within reason, can also contribute to skills like hand-eye coordination, strategic thinking, etc. Instead of these extreme measures, encouraging self-regulation and having open dialogues with the child about responsible usage may be more ethical and sensible."

If I\u2019m frustrated enough to call them out, I\u2019ll end up saying stuff like \u201cdude, can you fucking step back??\u201d  Or \u201chey, you know about personal space?\u201d \n\nOnly 1 person has ever apologized to me when I\u2019ve called them out. \n\nHe was a super big and tall guy waiting behind me at the polling place. I was standing in the same spot for a while, the line wasn\u2019t moving. I felt this guy bump into my back. \n\nI turned around told him calmly\u201chey, can you not stand so close to me?\u201d He scoffed at me and said \u201cwe\u2019re in a line\u201d I almost caused a scene and pointed out to him  \u201cdude, you just moved like, /inches/ behind me, I\u2019m a small woman I notice!! \u201d he took a step back and apologized to me. \n\nEvery other person I\u2019ve called out for standing too close to me will give me a stank face and continue standing close until I leave the store or area. Sometimes I feel like I embarrass people for calling them out, but at the same time, they deserve to be embarrassed for being a total weirdo.\n\n\nEDIT: \nI didn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m cursing out everyone who\u2019s standing a foot behind me in grocery store lines. It was an example of the only person who\u2019s apologized. I meant when people are standing a few inches behind me in uncrowded places like Walmart or Target, but thank you for making me rethink my approach.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because it involves a disregard for personal space, a fundamental aspect of human interaction. This disrespect can lead to discomfort and feelings of invasion, particularly when the person feeling intruded upon is smaller or feels vulnerable. Although it may be perfectly acceptable to make others aware if they are violating this space, the manner in which it is done is also of important consideration. Language that is argumentative, aggressive, or profane can escalate the situation rather than deescalate it, which is ethically inappropriate. The attempt to embarrass others, as stated in the scenario, also goes against commonsense respect and dignity principles, which believe in addressing issues constructively and respectfully without causing intentional embarrassment or discomfort. It\u2019s always best to maintain politeness and respect in all situations, even when one is feeling anxious or uncomfortable. Lastly, labeling someone as a \"total weirdo\" for standing too close can be unfair and unkind, as they might simply be unaware of their behavior. Inclusive and respectful dialogue is key to solving such misunderstandings."

My girlfriend did get the rabies vaccine and has on three occasions told me she would prefer if I got it too. \n\nOn the first occasion, we discussed the risks and benefits and I politely explained my reasons for opting not to which she seemed to accept.\n\nShe brought it up for a second time and offered to pay for the vaccination herself. Due to the inconvenience associated with the vaccination schedule, and my knowledge that her paying for my vaccination would take a fair chunk (~3%) out of the money she worked hard to save for this trip over the last year, I politely refused for a second time.\n\nOn the third occasion (today) she told me she has been worrying about what would happen if I got bitten by a rabid animal and that she would really like me to get the vaccination for her peace of mind. I responded that I genuinely appreciated her concern but explained that I had made my decision on the issue and felt that her repeated attempts to cajole me into getting the vaccination against my wishes were making me feel uncomfortable and controlled.\n\nWas it unfair of me to describe her behaviour as controlling?

First, in a relationship, both parties should respect each other's decisions, especially those regarding personal health and bodily autonomy. However, decision-making ought to be informed and consider the potential impacts on both individuals involved. In this case, while the individual has the right to choose not to get vaccinated, the potential consequences of rabies are severe. Plus, his decision not to vaccinate could lead to high levels of anxiety for his partner, adding emotional weight on her during their travels. Lastly, as a medical professional himself who is fully aware of the risks, disregarding the significance and role of preventative medicine seems inconsistent. The decision to not vaccinate for personal convenience does not align with the general social responsibility towards public health and hence, is deemed ethically unacceptable. However, in the follow-up actions, the ethical loopholes are largely corrected, as the conversation opened up, an apology is made, and the cost of the vaccine is shared, showing mutual respect and consideration."

Buckle up, this is gonna get long.\n\nSo, my best friend. Let\u2019s call her Mary. We\u2019ve been friends for over a decade and we get along great. Like any friends, we have disagreements but we can tell each other anything. We\u2019ve always been there for each other through painful breakups, bad grades on tests, big accomplishments, everything.\n\nMary recently got married and obviously I was thrilled for her. Now since high school at least, we\u2019d always talk about getting married, being in each other\u2019s bridal parties, etc. Obviously this is not a legally binding contract but things like that mean a lot to people, at least they did to me.\n\nSo several months before the wedding we\u2019re hanging out and she breaks the news to me that they\u2019ve decided to keep the bridal party family-only. Was I upset? Yeah, obviously, but hey, I can understand keeping things small. Then I find out that this family-only parry includes her fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother\u2019s girlfriend. Yeah, girlfriend. Not wife or even fianc\u00e9e, girlfriend. I was blindsided and hurt, because to me, that\u2019s NOT family. Mary and I might not share blood but in every other way we are sisters. I couldn\u2019t believe she would do this to me. I know that being a bridesmaid might not be a big deal to everyone, but to me this felt like a complete betrayal of our friendship.\n\nI told Mary I needed space and  she said she understood. We didn\u2019t talk for a few months, the longest ever, but eventually I decided I didn\u2019t want to lose our friendship over this. She knows more about me than probably anyone else in the world and I love her. So we made up and I went to the wedding. Honestly it was pretty painful for me to be there because I felt like an outsider rather than a best friend.

And yeah, like I said, I know this is all totally stupid, totally juvenile revenge. But it turns out I\u2019m still hurt and angry and I don\u2019t know what else to do. I tried talking to her about this before but I\u2019ve always known she was someone who has \u201cmisters before sisters\u201d priorities. I suspect it was his choice to do this for the bridal party for reasons I won\u2019t get into, which is why I know if I talk to her about it she\u2019ll just get defensive.\n\nI know I\u2019m being petty but am I being an asshole?\n        ",

They only feed into the cycle of hurt and misunderstanding, making it harder for both individuals to move forward, repair the friendship, and better understand one other's decisions and feelings. The ethical way to approach this would be open communication, discussing feelings openly and honestly, and trying to understand the reasons for the other's actions.

Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for the suggestions and help. I spoke with my parents and voiced my concerns. My mom seems to have come to her senses but my dad is still apathetic. I'm packing my bags at crashing at a friend's house until I go back to university. In the long run, I'm not sure what to do. I think a psychiatric ward would be best but there's no way I'll be able to get her to go on my own.\n        ",

When she introduced me to her dad he said his name was Bob but I should call him Mr.Lastname. Assuming this was a joke, I chuckled and said only if he calls me Dr.Lastname in 4 years, (I am in med school which he knew ahead of time). He responded basically saying, he will not be doing that and he is serious, he is adamant on being called Mr.Lastname. Not wanting to cause a scene I chuckled and walked away.\n\nRest of the night, I tried to avoid talking too him too much (I still talked to her mom I was not silent all night) and i called him his firstname several times but never Mr.Lastname. The first time I called him his first name he corrected me to Mr.Lastname but after that he did not correct me again but he was visibly upset. Besides this, I think everything went well.\n\nAfter dinner my girlfriend left with me and we talked about this. She said that she gets why i didnt want to call him Mr.Lastname but I should have, just to make him happy. I said that I am not 16 anymore and it was an asinine request. She is sort of upset with me (unfairly imo) but what annoys me is that she is not upset with her dad even though I think it was his fault for ruining the mood.\n\nThis was Friday night and I have got mixed opinions from different people, so in your opinions AITA?

He said his name was Bob, but I have to call him Mr.Lastname. To me that is him just trying to establish dominance over me. Additionally, not really sure how I came off as arrogant.

Ignoring this request repeatedly, despite being corrected, not only shows a lack of respect towards the dad but could also indirectly convey that he's not serious about maintaining a cordial rapport with the girlfriend's family.

It's been maybe 5 things in total. She's not moving in for a few more weeks so it's just me right now and she's living about 20 minutes away from where we've moved into. Whenever she finds something to buy that's a little on the larger side, like a dresser or end table, she wants me to go with her to pick it up purely for the purpose of having help to put it in the car. So far, I have on all occasions unless I was working. I know it seems unfair to not want to assist in the pick-up process but the people she's buying things from are also able to help her load whatever it is into the car, I think she just feels too shy to ask.\n\n Normally I wouldn't mind as much but I get up for work at 4am and then work 10+ hour days so when I get home I usually go to the gym and just want some down time afterwords before having to do it all over again. Right now, she's not working because her new job doesn't begin at the hospital until September so she has a lot of free time aside from watching people's kids on occasion. I'm more than happy to help with the unload process when she gets back because of course there's nobody to help but me. However, when she goes to pick it up there are already people capable of helping on site and it feels like a waste for me to go. She just texted me about going again tonight for a dresser and I really don't want to if it's not necessary but I figured I'd ask for an outside perspective on this before deciding. After all, I love her and people can make selfish decisions without realizing it. Hopefully this helps me figure out if my feelings are reasonable or not.\n\nEdit: I talked on the phone with her since I'm at work right now and explained how I was feeling. Basically, I said I want to be there to help but if you can find out ahead of time whether or not they can assist you that's helpful to know. If it's a guy's house and you don't feel comfortable or it's late at night I'll go no problem. But if it's a woman and at a reasonable time of day let's see what options we have. She agreed and said she tries to be considerate of my days I'm working. Also, Offer Up is different from Craigslist in the sense that sellers have profiles like a Facebook profile which usually includes a picture, feedback from people who have bought from them, and verification statuses of their drivers license and more. For these reasons, it's reasonably safer than CL and easier to gauge a seller for safety.\n        ",

This is arguably a lack of consideration for your wellbeing, which constitutes the basis for the ethical unacceptability. You both have common goals-to furnish your future home, but it's important to weigh each other's needs and constraints when accomplishing this task, and the onus of this understanding must be mutual."

She came over all done up, looking amazing. We had a wonderful dinner together and she loved the wine. \n\nNow here\u2019s where the trouble comes. After dinner she asked me if I could go get her another glass of wine. I took her wine glass, went to the kitchen, put it down on the counter, then filled it up and brought it back. \n\nShe immediately asked if I had washed the glass. Which I said no to because why would I need to wash a glass she\u2019s currently using? Then she asked if I got her a new glass, to which I also said no, mentally rolling my eyes at her weird OCD. Then she says she\u2019s asking because her glass had a lipstick mark on it from the red lipstick she was wearing, and if I didn\u2019t wipe it off the glass or get a new one then where did it go?\n\nAt this point she goes full Nancy Drew and heads to the kitchen where she finds her empty glass with the lipstick stain sitting on the counter. I guess what happened was that when I put her glass down and turned around to get the bottle of wine, I must have mixed up which glass she was using and poured the wine in a used glass that was sitting on the counter.\n\nRight away she\u2019s saying that she can\u2019t drink out of this glass, that\u2019s disgusting, etc.\n\nI pointed out to her that she\u2019s the only one who uses the wine glasses so it was obviously her own glass from a previous night so it\u2019s really no different than using the other one. She still kept insisting that is was gross and she wouldn\u2019t drink it, so I finally suggested she just pour the wine into the other glass. She also said no to this and insisted she wants fresh wine from the bottle in her proper glass. \n\nI told her there\u2019s no way I\u2019m pouring her a new glass of wine unless she drinks the one she already has, it\u2019s wasteful and the wine was very expensive, and she needed to get over her phobia as it was ruining the nice night we were having. \n\nThen she just straight up left. She said if she can\u2019t have a glass of wine the way she likes it here, then she\u2019s going to go home and have one herself at her apartment. \n\nShe thinks I owe her an apology for not getting her a new glass of wine, I think she owes me an apology for ruining the night and not getting help for her issues.  \n\nSo who\u2019s the asshole?\n        ",

On the other hand, the boyfriend's complaint about an expensive wine being wasted is also valid, as wasting resources is generally seen as being ethically wrong. So, his objection was more circumstantial and not completely without justification. The lack of communication, understanding, and patience from both ends escalated what could have been an easily solvable issue into a major conflict.

Allowing a gorilla, which is a strong and potentially dangerous animal, to roam free in a neighborhood puts people, especially children, at risk of harm. It's also unfair to the gorilla, who is better suited to a natural habitat or a properly equipped facility that caters to its needs. Moreover, it violates local laws related to animal control and public safety and shows disrespect to neighbors' rights to a safe living environment.

In this scenario, the mother was upset that her explicit instructions were blatantly disregarded, which lead to potential risk and unruly behavior, and she chose to express her discontent by ending the fun early.

I'll admit it was my bad for not asking her if she was ready to deal with a rant today- usually I do ask. Today, everything came crashing down, and I started spilling it all out. I'm not looking for advice or anything. I just needed her to tell me everything was going to be okay. She told me to indulge in the things I usually do in order to calm down. I tried to explain to her that I just had no energy to even do the things I usually like, and she told me to essentially suck it up and do it anyways.

On the other hand, the girlfriend's response seems dismissive and lacks emotional support which is needed in such situations. Instead of actively listening and understanding, she labels the person's explanation of their feelings as 'melodramatic'. The interaction lacks respect and emotional maturity, which are key ingredients for any healthy relationship, making this scenario ethically unacceptable. Furthermore, pushing personal emotional burdens onto others without their consent or professional ability to handle such situations can also be considered ethically unacceptable.

My middle cousin gave grandma her first great grandbaby. When I started going to college, grandma started liking me again, but that seemed to end quickly when she found out I medically withdrew.\n\nBecause I never \"earned grandma's love,\" she's always been really petty and nasty towards me, especially around the holidays. Most notable is the Christmas my brother was born. My parents were still in the hospital on Christmas Eve, so I was alone with my grandparents. My grandmother screamed at me that I was an ungrateful child, my parents give me everything and I squander it, and I'm horribly disrespectful and don't deserve what they give me. I didn't tell my parents for years. It got worse, but I always took it because my brother loved having the family together for Christmas.\n\nThree Christmases ago, grandma started acting nasty towards my little brother. Even to the point that she made him cry on his birthday because she accidentally caused him to spill his milkshake but ended up screaming at him that he was acting ridiculous and that it was all his fault and he didn't deserve the milkshake in the first place. That's when my hatred really began to fester.\n\nTwo Christmases ago, I was late to Christmas because of work.

Transparency is important in maintaining trust, a cornerstone principle of ethics.\n4. Ill-considered priority: Even though the boy enjoys magic, his decision to spend a substantial amount of money on a hobby without discussing with his parents - who likely funded the card - shows a lack of consideration and respect.\n5. Lack of remorse: Instead of showing contrition, the boy further justifies his actions, indicating a lack of moral insight into his misbehavior. This shows a disregard for ethical norms like honesty and respect for others' resources.\n\nIn conclusion, the boy's actions are ethically unacceptable as he broke trust, acted irresponsibly, and didn't show remorse for his actions."

My co-worker has a physical disability that affects her productivity, to a degree that is obvious to everyone in the office. This morning, I discovered that her salary is the same as mine. \n\nI was a bit upset because I\u2019m way more productive and have only had outstanding evaluations. I started researching wage parity laws and discovered that up in Washington state their legislature just passed a wage parity law for workers with mental and physical disabilities. I think this is a bad idea for so many reasons, but the important thing is my state isn\u2019t bound by this bad policy (yet). At least none that I could find.\n\nSo I met with my boss this afternoon and requested a higher salary. He said he understands my frustration and he\u2019ll discuss the issue with HR. I told him my main issue is that I want my compensation to be reflective of my work and if it means either I get a raise or she (the disabled worker) gets a pay reduction, I\u2019m ok with it. Obviously I don\u2019t wish my co-worker ill will and prefer it to be a raise for me. I talked to my sister about this and she told me I was being an ass. She\u2019s kind of PC. I really don\u2019t feel that\u2019s the case. I want my salary to reflect my value to the company and that is not too much to ask. Am I right? \n\nEdit/Info: salary for us = base salary + benefits + bonus. For the same position, the base pay will be fairly similar but it does differ depending on the hire's years of experience and negotiating skills at the time of contracts. Where there can be a rather sizeable difference is in the annual bonus.\n\nUpdate: Sorry for the brief update. The mods asked me to write here since it hasn\u2019t been a day yet. In the end, I didn\u2019t get the raise I asked for because there isn\u2019t anything HR can do about compensation until the next contract cycle. What I got was a lot more meaningful and lasting, however.\n\n1. My boss was so impressed with my professionalism and courage in discussing a thorny personnel issue that he offered me additional opportunities that go beyond the scope of my current responsibilities. He had been deciding between me and another worker in the group for these professional development opportunities, but he was impressed by my discussion with him yesterday, helping him make the final decision. These opportunities will take me on work travel with him in the next few months to company-wide work groups and meetings where I will present. These opportunities are meant to increase my exposure to other parts of the corporation and facilitate interaction with folks at the executive level. He was quite frank: I\u2019m being groomed for the next level and he has recommended me as a candidate for a position that will come up within the next year. \n\n2. My boss already noticed I had been editing, refining, and polishing my disabled colleague\u2019s work product without being asked. My colleague has real productivity issues and since I already mastered my responsibilities and am more efficient, I had been covering problems created by her performance. He realized he did not document this in his last annual review and already added a letter in my file to document additional merit. This will mean more bonus supposedly. However, he now wants me to focus my extra time on professional development with him, which means my disabled colleague\u2019s deficits will be even more apparent. Unfortunate.\n\n3. Perhaps most important, I learned to trust my instinct. Speak up even when people might (gasp) think you\u2019re an asshole. \n\nThank you so much everyone! Lots of good news today and so glad I approached my boss yesterday!\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. Although it is fair to relate compensation to productivity and contributions to some extent, demand for higher pay based on a co-worker's disability can come off as discriminative and unempathetic. Disability inclusion and equal opportunity employment are important ethical considerations in workplace that override pure efficiency or productivity considerations. More importantly, the protagonist's willingness to entertain the idea of his disabled colleague's pay reduction further accentuates the lack of empathy and understanding. The scenario also raises questions about privacy and respect, as discussing a co-worker's salary is generally considered inappropriate. While the protagonist's desire for fair compensation and career advancement is understandable, their approach lacks proper appreciation for the complexities and sensitivities around disability in the workplace."

We live in the US and have good jobs and enjoy a comfortable lifestyle with our two young daughters (ages 5, 7). I work hard so that I can save and travel, it's what we do as a family and what we really enjoy. Important Note: We are not rich, not by any standards. We just prioritize travel and creating experiences over buying things. We've visited several continents with our kids and have plans to travel to Mexico this upcoming Spring Break.\n\nMy husband has a kid sister whom we became guardians over 2 years ago--she is now a senior in high school. I initiated this and brought her from her country to live with us so that she could have a better future. This decision obviously created lots of change for our family--our two daughters now share a room instead of having their own, we have family dinner together every night as a family of five, I am her advocate getting her into a great high school, finding her counseling for trauma she has experienced, creating structure for things like homework, a chore chart around the house with allowance, drivers ed, doctor appointments, planning for university, etc etc. Last year I paid for her to do a 6 week trip back to her country to visit her friends/family and over XMas this year I am bringing her with us (obviously--it's the holidays) as we visit my parents in Arizona--she'll get a 3 week fun trip at a resort-like location with the rest of us. I've encouraged her several times to consider getting a part time job so she can pay for gas when she starts driving (we are providing her a vehicle at no cost) and other things she might want to buy (makeup, post-high school travel or other plans, etc). She has yet to do this even though she says she wants one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the question--AITA? We are planning a Spring Break trip to Mexico and I'll be honest, it's a bit expensive. I told my husband that I feel comfortable having his sister stay home for the week (she'll be an 18 year old sr in HS) and has stayed home previously for shorter things, and she is very trustworthy. Husband blew up at my and told me it was unreasonable to leave her at home and that if we go we need to pay for her ticket too. I said that if she wanted to go she could have gotten a part time job and shown initiative in saving money for things that are important to her. Our relationship with this young woman is very good, but it is not one of parent/child--we are like her aunt/uncle helping her the most we can. I do not feel obligated to support her in every single way. I feel that we've been more than generous throughout the past few years, and will continue to do so. We're at a standstill--can you help??\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The stance taken by the narrator seems discriminatory, even if unintentional. Although they don't consider themselves as parents of the young woman, they accepted a guardian role, which comes with certain responsibilities, not only of providing a safe home but also maintaining emotional stability. The young woman was uprooted from her home, introduced into a different family dynamic, and exposed to a distinctly different lifestyle. Excluding her from a family trip can create a sense of alienation and damage her sense of belongingness to the family. This can potentially deepen unresolved traumas, feelings of isolation, and overall emotional health. Even though it's critical to teach teenagers about financial responsibility, consistent family structure and inclusivity take precedence and are more morally credible actions. Timing and manner of delivering these lessons are important and sensitive."

Until last week, I had seen and waved to him a handful of times, but we never spoke.\n\nLast week I'm driving when he waves me down. Initially he just starts chatting me up about my truck. Our trucks are very similar and I mention how I'm always impressed with the immaculate paint on his. He tells me to hold on and runs to his driveway to grab his detailing bag. I'm just sitting in the middle of the residential street, but it's a quiet street so no big deal. He hands me his business card, and starts showing me the products he uses. It's half a sales pitch, but he looked genuinely excited to meet his neighbor and show off his business.\n\nHe tells me I should observe him apply this wax coating product he uses and he starts walking to his truck. I say \"do you want me to get out and come take a look?\" to which he replies \"if you'd like!\" and I respond \"let me park first\" -- I put my truck into reverse and turn the wheel to back up against the curb. I start reversing and hear a loud CRUNCH and see him running back out into the street yelling \"noooo!!!\"\n\nApparently this dude thought to leave his detailing bag leaning against my front tire! Real smart. I crushed a bunch of cleaning products but he was focused on his glasses and how he just got them and they are $300 prescription glasses. He looks mad at himself and maybe mad at me but is trying to hide it. He keeps going \"it's ok, it's ok, mistakes happen\" and still wants me to come check out 'how his product works.\n\nI park and walk over. He still has a smile but every few seconds he's going 'ah shit ah fuck' under his breath -- I leave telling him I'm sorry for running over his glasses but I'll give him business and in touch soon to make a detailing appointment.\n\nFast forward to today. He waves me down again while I'm driving, all smiles. Says something along the line of \"Hey bud, I checked with my insurance and they won't cover the glasses. It's going to be $500 *($200 more than he had originally said)*, do you think you could give me $100 toward it?\" Before I could give any sort of real response a car was coming and he said \"we can talk later, it doesn't have to be today or anything.\" I told him I would be in touch soon for a detailing and kind of ignored the $100 thing, but I got the feeling he inferred I would be willing to.\n\nNow, I don't feel I owe this man anything. I'm not the one who left valuables in the middle of the road against the tire of a running vehicle. HOWEVER, I will have to see this man a lot; because of his business he always seems to be in his driveway and he can spot my truck from a mile away. It seems like maybe the non-asshole thing to do is just help him out with his glasses and be done with it and not have to worry about awkward interactions every time I pass him.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I just ignore the situation? What do I even say the next time he flags me down?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the feedback. I think I'm just going to give him the $100 he requested for the sole sake of not having to think about this ever again.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable because of the principle of personal responsibility. It was not the truck owner's fault that the neighbor left his belongings next to the truck tire: he couldn't anticipate this unusual action and hence couldn't avoid running over the glasses. The truck owner is not morally obligated to compensate for damage caused by an act that was primarily due to the neighbor's negligence. The decision to offer $100, even though not required, can be seen as a kind-hearted gesture to preserve a good neighborhood relationship, which is also ethically exemplary in showing concern for maintaining harmony in social relationships. However, the truck owner would not have been an asshole if he decided not to pay as he was not at fault."

We are currently negotiating various business deals that I\u2019m excited about. \n\nThe problem is that my daughter claims that my business partner\u2019s daughter is a bully and is still bullying her on social media. \n\nMy daughter, who\u2019s been figure skating since she was 4, was training as if she was going to do this professionally for years. \n\nTwo years ago, her training center changed owners to the one now. The owner was a former skater himself, and became one of my daughter\u2019s coaches. \n\nHis daughter was one of the skaters. She became popular with the other skaters very quickly. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t take to my daughter and vice verse. \n\nWhen she\u2019d host get togethers my daughter was not invited. Instead of focusing on her craft, my daughter began engaging in petty social media drama with the other girl and would overeat and subsequently get criticized when her outfits wouldn\u2019t fit. \n\nWe expected at 18, she\u2019d either be doing this professionally like most of her peers are, or have gotten a scholarship to a good university. Instead, she\u2019s at home with hundreds of thousands wasted. Instead she is brooding over the fact that the coach\u2019s daughter implied she was fat. \n\nNow she\u2019s asking me to allow her actions to impact her career. She refuses to be civil to the family and calls me immoral and a bunch of other words. She also seems to be intent on sabotaging my business relationship. \n\nWe had an argument last night where I told her that just because she let somebody she didn\u2019t see eye to eye with ruin her life, doesn\u2019t mean I would be doing the same. She is 18 years old and can get a job and/ or her own place. \n\nNot being invited to parties is a part of life, and so is being criticized- I refuse to sacrifice a great thing just because my daughter is accusing someone of being a bully. \n\nAITA for telling her that since she hates the way I align myself with business partners, she can  have thirty days to move out, since I can\u2019t just not pay my bills just because of her petty drama?\n        ",

Ignoring this conflict and allowing them to potentially escalate in severity significantly compromises the daughter's mental and emotional health.\n\nSecondly, prioritizing business relationships over familial relationships, specifically in cases where emotional harm is at stake, is ethically problematic. Although it's understandable that the parent needs to maintain their business, excluding their own child to do so goes against commonsense familial bonds and duties. \n\nLastly, the lack of support given to the daughter when she's facing body shaming and resulting negative self-esteem issues is troubling. Instead of addressing the psychological damage inflicted on the daughter, the parent dismisses the issue as \"petty drama\", minimizing her struggles and effectively blaming her for the difficulties she's facing. This dismissive attitude can further aggravate her mental well-being and is therefore ethically unacceptable."

She approached me, admitted something I didn't need to hear (bad parents, no friends, bullied, writing was her only escape, blah, blah, blah) and asked me to take down my story. I didn't because that wasn't her right to ask me. Someone starts the rumor I 'stole the idea'. My readers didn't take this to well. In attempt to defend me they called this 12 year old a lot of names, small things like loser, retard, freak, idiot, told her her writing was shit, it sucked. I didn't particpate in any name caller so I don't blame myself for that. \n\nTalking about it my friends think I was a complete bitch, but I don't see it like that. I took an idea I liked and created my own version with it. So yes, thoughts?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. It's unacceptable because the original concept of the story belonged to the 12-year-old writer. Using this idea without their explicit permission comprises plagiarism, which is generally considered unethical. Even though the synthesis and resulting presentation were unique, the basic elements were taken from someone else's work without acknowledgment. In addition, ignoring the young author's request to take down the story shows a disregard for others' feelings and original creative expressions. Finally, although the writer didn't participate in the name-calling, they didn't attempt to stop it either, demonstrating a lack of empathy and encouraging an age-inappropriate and harmful environment for the younger writer. By human commonsense, respecting others' work and feelings is a fundamental aspect of ethical behavior, which is violated in this scenario."

I live in Tennessee and my dad moved back to Ohio a few years ago to be near his parents and siblings as they age, plus my sisters and I are all grown and scattered about. So I\u2019ve seen my dad maybe 7-8 times in the last 3 years, and even though we aren\u2019t super close, we get along and I love the old man.\n\nWe also have one big thing in common: football. I grew up watching Ohio State games with my dad every fall. We\u2019d always grill out and have a great time, but I haven\u2019t been able to watch a single game with him since he moved away. Because of this, and upon discovering the Ohio State-Michigan game (biggest game of the season for either team) falls on Thanksgiving weekend, I thought that would be a perfect time for my daughter [6F] and I to make a trip up.\n\nThis past Friday rolls around and my younger sister Liddy [20F] calls me to chat. I hadn\u2019t made any decisions about Ohio at this point, just some general thoughts on the idea, but I figured she might want to go if she didn\u2019t have any other plans. So I ask her if she\u2019d go if I finalize plans.\n\nWell, turns out my 3 sisters were out to dinner a few weeks ago and Abby [25F] tells the other 2 that our mom [56F] is planning to use Thanksgiving for her wedding reception with her new fianc\u00e9e [~65M] because she anticipates us all being there.\n\nThis rubbed me the wrong way for a few reasons.\n\n-She plans to commandeer a big holiday to make it about her and her marriage.\n\n-She only told Abby and the rest of us only know because she\u2019s spilling the beans (because Abby wasn\u2019t told to spread this news).\n\n-She expects us to be there without clearing it with us first. I have two kids, Abby and Liddy have serious boyfriends, and Annie [30F] is almost always traveling, so you have to let us know this type of stuff well in advance.\n\nThose things alone are reasons for me to not want to go, but she\u2019s also onto her 4th marriage. She has made it increasingly clear over the last year that she isn\u2019t super seriously in love with the guy, just that he\u2019s got acceptable qualities and she\u2019s lonely and needs financial stability. So we never expected a reception or anything notable in the first place.\n\nAs soon as Liddy told me about this, I decided to finalize plans to go to Ohio for Thanksgiving. I was probably going to do it anyway, but the way my mom is handling this whole marriage/holiday thing, I\u2019d rather just not be around. \n\nSo AITA for going all-in on my plans to make sure I\u2019m not around on my mom\u2019s \u201cspecial day?\u201d\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The individual is prioritizing their own happiness, peace, and shared interests with their father over attending their mother's wedding reception. Given the impersonal way the mother communicated her plans, her expectation for her children to automatically attend without consultation, and the individual's lack of enthusiasm for the mother's multiple marriages, the individual doesn't hold any moral obligation to attend the wedding reception. Moreover, they are taking into account the interests of their own child, ensuring they spend quality time with their grandparents. Thus, it seems reasonable ethically to prioritize their own plans over a commitment that has not been communicated properly."

Overall the switch + games + accessories cost about $420 (ayyy) and as I have a job and I\u2019m older, I agreed to paying for most of it ($300).\n\nWe gave ourselves about 3 months to save up money, but by the end of it, my sister didn\u2019t have enough for her $120 share (she was always spending money and hanging out with her friends.)\n\nBut I still wanted a Switch so I said I would cover her as long as she paid me back via artwork and drawings. She\u2019s a great artist and she does do commissions, so we agreed that I would pay for her and in exchange, she would create 3-4 drawings for me.\n\nSo we bought the switch back in January and we both use it. Anyhow, I asked her to draw me a portrait of my friend for her birthday, nothing too strenuous, asked her 3 weeks in advance and gave her all the info she needed. She never delivered and i was angry, but I just bought my friend another present last minute so I wasn\u2019t too upset.\n\nAnyhow fast forward to February and she did the same thing. Then more recently, I asked if she could draw a character I liked from a TV show and she just straight up told me that she didn\u2019t want to, that she never wanted to, that she didn\u2019t know why I kept asking her to draw shit and that I was not entitled to her drawings.\n\nI reminded her that her drawing for me was literally apart of the deal we had on the Nintendo switch but she said it\u2019s been months since we got it so we should just drop it.\n\nSo I did just that and now I\u2019m refusing to let her play the switch, of course she\u2019s angry but I said it was technically my Switch now since I paid for it 100%. I brought it up to my mom and she said I need to be the bigger person here (figuratively and literally) and share it with my sister. AITA in this situation?\n\n# EDIT AND UPDATE:\n\nWhen I went to bed, this post had like 30 comments and there was no new ones coming in so I was sure it'd be dead. SUPER surprised to see 1K+ comments when I woke up! There's a lot of concerns I would like to address in the comments section but the only one I want to address is that I'm a college student who pays for my own rent, car payments, car insurance, my priority is putting money in my ROTH and 401K etc. so it DOES take me a while to save up to buy games. \n\nAnyhow, she actually came knocking on my door after lunch and apologized to me. She said her actions were unnecessary and she was mortified about how immature she acted. I kind of lectured her on financial responsibility and she took it very well actually! We started a change jar so she could save up, even if only a little bit at a time. We negotiated and I said the 3-4 drawing offer still stands, but I won't let her play with it until she creates at least one, and that I want the other three drawings done by the end of this year. So now she's drawing Haley from Stardew Valley. Some people are going to say I'm too lenient, but in the long run it's probably better off like this.\n        ",

It was clearly stated that she would be expected to contribute through creating artwork for her older sibling. When she chooses not to, it is fair that she suffers the consequence of not being allowed to use the gaming console. Moreover, the older sibling demonstrates understanding and offers her multiple chances to fulfill her side of the deal, showing patience and mercy. Additionally, when the younger sister realizes her mistake and apologizes, the older sibling forgives her and reiterates the conditions for usage of the console, highlighting ethical conduct, fairness, and compassionate behavior in the scenario."

Because of the distance, they have been discussing whether or not they will try to make things work, and they have struggled to make a decision. He asked his mom and me what we thought he should do, and for a long time I refused to advise him other than to make some very high level comments and generalizations. His mother/my wife, on the other hand, has encouraged him to stay with his girlfriend, even though I asked her to remain impartial. \n\nMy son continued to ask me for my opinion, and because his mom weighed in I felt like he needed to hear my perspective. This is because my wife has used us as an example to show him that high school sweethearts can last. She is not wrong, but she has only given one side of our story to our son and I felt he needed to know my perspective, which I have not shared with our kids until now.\n\nTo make a long story short, we were high school sweethearts, but in many ways I regret choosing to make a commitment to my wife when we were so young. We had a similar issue. I applied to graduate schools and ended up getting offers from schools in NY and LA which I really liked. I would have probably attended one, but my wife did not want to move to either place, which forced me to choose. I have always wondered how my life would have gone had I chosen a different path. \n\nI told my son all of this and advised him to think about if he wants that hanging over him while he is away at school. To be tied down like this during the best years of his life is going to give him a very different college experience and probably limit him in many ways. I did not tell him he should break up, but I did strongly urge him to consider if he is prepared to make that sacrifice and end up like me wondering what he missed out on.\n\nApparently my daughter overheard this conversation and relayed it to my wife.

He may feel pressured to avoid your perceived mistakes, which isn't fair to him or to his relationship. Lastly, sharing this conversation in a space where others (like your daughter) could overhear it is disrespectful to the privacy of your wife and adds an unnecessary degree of conflict to the situation.

When I told him that I didn\u2019t want to get an abortion, he got really upset and said I got pregnant on purpose to try and trap him because I knew he was going out of the country (he\u2019s in the Army), I just wanted his money and how I should prepare to be a single mother, be on section 8, welfare, food stamps etc. then proceeded to threaten me. Carlos told me he did not want his mom to know about the baby then blocked me from both of their social media profiles.\n\nWhile Carlos was getting ready to leave the country, he was staying with his mom in a different state. Then, he tells me the Army changed his orders and he\u2019s now going to be stationed in a state off the mainland and living there permanently. At this point, we were still arguing sometimes, but not as often as before. Carlos also tells me he still hasn\u2019t told his mom and still wasn\u2019t planning on doing so. \n\nHe tells me he wants to know when I go into labor, when I\u2019m at the hospital, and when the baby is born and if everything\u2019s fine. I agree and do that. For the first few weeks after our daughter was born, we were getting along great and weren\u2019t arguing at all. \n\nA couple months go by, Carlos and I are still getting along so I make the suggestion that he should meet his daughter. He seems to be open to me flying with our daughter to stay with him for about a week. We start to make plans for us to go in the summer, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to pay for anything because he just moved into an apartment/condo and his rent is an insane amount and he barely has any money. I tell him I would be willing to pay for the ticket to go out there and at first he says no, but then comes around to the idea. After this, it seems to me he started trying to find any and every reason to start an argument. I finally say that I\u2019ve had enough and tell him I\u2019m done and I\u2019m not going to come out there and I\u2019m not going to send him anymore pictures of our daughter until he can apologize to me for the way he\u2019s been treating me.\n\n I blocked him on every other social media and I filed for child support. Carlos is now telling some of his friends that I am crazy, I\u2019m keeping his daughter away from him and he doesn\u2019t fully believe that she\u2019s his daughter. He still hasn\u2019t told his mom as far as I know, so I tried reaching out to her twice, both times I didn\u2019t hear anything back from her. \n\nMy daughter is now 6 months old and next week I have to take her out to do a paternity test. I have been feeling like a real dick for filing for child support after saying I wouldn\u2019t in the beginning of my pregnancy.

However, the situation has drastically changed. While you tried your best for a co-parenting arrangement, Carlos neither assumed his responsibility of fatherhood nor treated you respectfully. As a single mother, there is a growing financial burden to ensure the wellbeing of your child. Therefore, filing for child support becomes a justified choice, not a manipulative one. \n\nCarlos avoiding to acknowledge and support his child is a breach of ethical norms of parenthood. It would be morally incorrect to continue to bear all the hardships alone, especially considering the emotional and financial toll. Therefore, while you may feel uneasy, your decision aligns with human commonsense and is ethically acceptable."

She has a bleeding disorder and a family history of ovarian cysts, and I am a bit concerned about whether or not we will even be able to have children. \nYesterday, we found out that for yet another month, we were unsuccessful.

He sleeps on a couch and I sleep on a stiff mattress. My parents stay up later than us so we don\u2019t sleep well because we can hear the TV and then talking. We are also woken up very early in the morning when the dogs want out, and I\u2019m typically the one to get up and let them out because I can\u2019t stand them whining and my parents hushing them.

I never really liked her then boyfriend, and never really supported the relationship. The guy can't hold a job, and there were many times that she had to have 2 jobs to pay his portion of the bills. Then they broke up and she chased after some other guy, and when he ghosted her, she was suddenly engaged to first guy and gave 3 months to plan the wedding. I was her MOH, and I live a few states away from her. So I kept my opinion of the wedding to myself. I offered to buy all the wedding favors, decorations, etc and she turned down every offer. \n\nWe got into several arguments because she said I wasn't helping like I should be, but being several states away, there was only so much I could do except for offer to help financially. And it honestly pissed me off that I was doing everything I possibly could and she still wasn't happy. \n\nFast forward, I go down for the wedding with my then 11 month old. Keep in mind that I drove 8 hours without my husband, with an 11 month old, for this wedding. I stayed in town for a week so that I could do all the bridesmaids events. I was staying with my parents, who still had to work. She was upset that I was bringing my son to everything, but then was upset if i said i couldn't do something because i had my kid. She genuinely was mad that my family wasn't available to watch him so it really felt like a lose lose for me. \n\nBachelorette party rolls around, we were all pretty trashed. She thought I was passed out drunk and started trash talking my husband. That was kinda the final straw for me. I have never trashed her now husband to anyone. He doesn't abuse her, doesn't call her names, so therefor it isn't my place to say what I think. So I was extremely upset. And the whole party her friend was asking me weird questions that you just dont ask in everyday conversation. The questions made it very obvious that she had been talking about me.\n\nI go to the wedding, give my MOH speech, and stayed the entire reception, where my kid wasn't allowed (kid free reception) but she wanted him to be a ring bearer (which is why i brought him out of town with me). That whole trip was hell on me physically and financially. So after all was said and done I decided to just quietly distance myself from her because I was so upset at how I had been treated for those 3 months. \n\nShe sent me a message asking why I've been so quiet and I told her that I thought she treated me really poorly and her saying that it was HER wedding was not an excuse to treat her best friend that way. Basically it blew up, she started trashing me on facebook so now i have her blocked everywhere. \n     \nSide note: she said \"you couldnt even put motherhood on hold for one day for me.\" AITA?\n        ",

The chain of thought leading to this conclusion is as follows: Regardless of the circumstances such as a wedding, basic respect towards another individual should not be compromised. The best friend's behavior towards the protagonist, which involved immense demands and unreasonable criticism, was disrespectful, hence justifying the protagonist's decision to distance herself. The protagonist fulfilled her tasks as a bridesmaid and a friend to the best of her capability, given her physical distance and responsibilities as a new mother. The friend's derogatory comments about the protagonist and her family were also unjustified. The decision to maintain one's boundaries and mental health is crucial, which is what the protagonist did by ending a toxic friendship."

He told me I couldn't tell anyone but someone had to know why he would never be happy, get married, have children and would die alone.

It's generally accepted that coming out is an intensely personal decision and process, and forcibly outing someone could potentially cause further emotional distress.

For this reason whenever she gets upset I always end up an emotional wreck too. I feel inadequate and have all her negativity forced on me when I had NOTHING to do with it, like emotional collateral damage. \n\nA couple nights ago I got off work. I intended to renew my soon expiring driver's license. The DMV closed in a half hour and it was about 15 minutes away. I got a message from her saying she was now upset about something between her and her roommate. I apologized but said I couldn't talk now. She gave me an apology for bothering me that I sensed some resentment in. I felt shitty so I pulled over and messaged her saying she had to come first. No response. I got to the DMV. Still no response. I completed renewing my license and gave her a very heartfelt apology and saying I was fully open now. No response. I got home and said the same. No response.

She had reposted some memes from relationship groups about how you deserve better than someone who can't support you in bad moments and things like that without mentioning me or anyone by name. I called her...no answer. I gave her a very tearful apology and begged her to talk. No response. I saw she had read my last few messages though. I went to bed without talking to her and sent her some emojis about how I loved her.

It wasn't until halfway through my workday (so basically 20 hours later) I got any response at all and it was just complaining about we have a communication problem. I told her \"well those are solved with more communication, not less.\" She seemed pretty annoyed and blew up at me. I ran over on my lunch because I was talking and calming her down. Finally she warmed up but not before making excuses for her silent treatment and claiming she was worried she'd say something nasty to me. I told her I'd prefer that to silence and she could simply say she doesn't want to talk now instead of ghosting me.

Finally, the intention to cut-off the guest from future functions if she doesn't pay has undertones of emotional manipulation, which is generally considered ethically unsound.\n\nIn conclusion, while the guests' interruption of the photos is inconsiderate, the hosts' proposed reaction is ethically worse, as it involves coercion and unfair demands."

The individual's laughter at the excessive response and defense against accusations were within the bounds of reason, demonstrating their disbelief and refusal to accept an unjust, severe characterization of their actions.

However, I also figured that what I do is my own business, and if I always keep it locked up when it's at home (I do), and neither of us has children over ever, it would never affect her in any way.\n\nHowever, a mutual friend brought it up in casual conversation, and my roommate completely flipped out when she found out.

Don't you think you're being just a little bit ridiculous? \n\nWell, Mac and Ann ended up leaving in a bit of a dramatic flourish.

In this scenario, you made the dish yourself from a recipe learned directly from an Indian family that you used to live with, and you made it clear where the recipe came from. You did not use it for profit and the intent was to share something you love with your friends, not to appropriate or disrespect the Indian culture.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The first problem is the expectation that you can direct or control how and with whom your friend spends her time. It's essential to accept that everyone has the right to pursue their own interests and relationships. Secondly, there seems to be an emotionally possessive undertone in the expressed resentment towards your friend and her boyfriend. This is not healthy or constructive in a friendship. Lastly, clinging to the idea that she 'replaced' you or 'gave' something that was shared between you two to her boyfriend is indicative of objectification. This thinking pattern fails to value her individuality and autonomy. Although your feelings are understandable, your reaction towards the situation may harm the friendship in the long run."

A core reason is the violation of the guinea pigs' right to life, especially considering they are often kept as pets, seen as companions, and are not typically viewed as sources of food in many cultures.

Each apartment is given one parking spot, and anyone visiting needs to park on the street. The spots are labeled by apartment number as well. Also important to note that there are a lot of car break ins in my area. \n\nWell, a few weeks ago I came home from work and saw my neighbor\u2019s girlfriend was parked in my spot. I know it was her because I have met them both before, and have seen her park on the street when visiting on other occasions. \n\nI shrugged it off at first. I had been working late and they might\u2019ve thought I wasn\u2019t going to be home that night. So I parked on the street for the night. The next day I went to work and saw she was no longer in my spot. But when I got home that evening, she was parked there again. \n\nIt annoyed me, but I didn\u2019t want to say anything to my landlord knowing they would have her car towed. I know how expensive that can be, so I wanted to at least try and say something to my neighbor before taking that step. \n\nThe next morning, my car had been broken into. Luckily I didn\u2019t have anything of value inside, but my driver side window was shattered. It was extremely frustrating to deal with. That night when I got home I ran into my neighbor, his girlfriend was finally not in my spot. I politely asked that he tell his girlfriend to park on the street in the future, and he got really defensive with me. He complained that one parking spot isn\u2019t enough and that his girlfriend didn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving her car on the street. He also ignored me when I told him mine had been broken into. \n\nA few days passed, I got my window fixed and his girlfriend hadn\u2019t been at our building. And then one night I come home to see her parked in my spot, AGAIN. I was pretty fed up and decided to send my landlord a text. Her car was towed away within a couple of hours and I moved my car into my spot. \n\nI haven\u2019t seen my neighbor since this happened, but he left a pretty rude note on my door the day after. He was demanding I pay the $150 that it cost to get her car back, and demanded an apology as well. I will not be doing either. AITA for having his girlfriend towed out of my parking spot? I feel like I gave him the chance to prevent this.\n\nA pretty boring UPDATE: I brought a copy of his note to my landlord and she thanked me for bringing it to her attention. She told me to call right away if he tries to be confrontational with me, and she said that she would be talking with him. I\u2019m not sure exactly what that will entail for him, but I\u2019m hoping he learns his lesson. \n\nAlso, as much as I would love to send him a bill for my broken window, I don\u2019t want to provoke him any further. A lot of comments were referring to me as \u201che\u201d, which I didn\u2019t really feel the need to correct, but I am a woman, I\u2019m 23 and I live alone. I\u2019d like to think he wouldn\u2019t do anything crazy, but I can\u2019t be sure and I want to keep myself safe. \n\nThank you for all the responses, I feel a lot better about this now!!\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The individual acted within her rights to protect her designated parking space. The space is tied to her apartment and intended for her private use. Despite the recurring violation of her space, she initially showed restraint and tried to resolve the issue by communicating with her neighbor prior to involving a higher authority. Her own vehicle was even violated as a direct result of her courtesy in allowing the girlfriend to park in her spot. When she eventually did resort to reporting the violation to the landlord, it was an entirely reasonable step to take. Moreover, with neither the neighbor nor his girlfriend showing respect or empathy for her situation, she was justified in protecting her rights. Her request to the landlord followed a breach of basic societal rules and respectful co-existence norms, and her stance against the costs from towing is also justified, as she was not the party in the wrong."

The service provided: Regardless of the personal relationship, the girlfriend is still performing a service as a waitress.

The workplace standards: Her place of employment likely assumes tips as part of waitress's wage. Not tipping her could potentially affect her overall income, even if the couple has a shared financial setup.\n   \n3. Biases in behavior: The action shows a potential bias in behavior, behaving differently purely based on a personal relationship. This could be seen as unfair.\n   \n4. Setting precedents: It could set a poor precedent, not only for the couple but also for other customers who witness this. They might deem it as acceptable behavior and follow suit.\n   \n5.

Therefore, making him pay for everyone else's meals would only be justified if it was previously established as a shared cost.

Now we are 3 years in, planning a wedding & my MIL is overjoyed and even proposed to cover most of the wedding expenses.\n\nNeedless to say, I always felt I \"lucked out\" on a MIL.\n\nThing is, my bf is not the only son of my MIL. There is also a younger son who is already married (5 years) and I have to admit... The way MIL treats me and his wife, let's call her Kate, is like day and night.\n\nWith Kate she is cold, unwelcoming, sometimes even passive-agressive. At first I thought it is because Kate is just as cold and mean to MIL but I got a short version of the story from my bf after some coaxing. Apparently MIL simply disliked Kate from the very beginning and as the relationship got closer to marriage MIL got progressively colder until she outright encouraged the brother to break up with her because he can do better than Kate. That got shutdown real quick so MIL just settled on making it clear to Kate that she disapproves of her by simply ignoring her, excluding her or acting very coldly yet polite enough so bringing it up seems like an overreaction. \n\nI actually kept a friendly relationship with Kate from the get go and Kate sometimes ranted about the \"monster-in-law\" but otherwise seemed to be happy at least MIL isnt mean to me. But...recently during family dinner (FIL's birthday) when Kate was present, MIL said how happy she is that I will finally be an official part of the family and, since we seem to not be able to settle for an engagement ring (we got engaged without it), she would like to give me her grandmother's ring as she \"finally has a daughter to give it to\".\n\nAfter hearing that Kate stormed out with her husband on her tail. Later I called Kate and when she finally picked up she said that she is done with me and MIL. She screamed a lot but a short version is that I am just as bad as MIL in treating her like shit because I keep taking whatever MIL gives me and never tell her off for being \"a cruel and petty woman\". I apologized but she said that if I want to apologise I need to do it with *the* ring. I said it's not mine to give.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The key issue here is that the situation involves a significant imbalance of fairness and respect. Your mother-in-law (MIL) is clearly showing favoritism, which is hurting Kate, and you're indirectly partaking in this by accepting the preferential treatment. Despite your own good relationship with your MIL, not speaking out against the blatant mistreatment of Kate shows complicity, which is morally concerning. Additionally, accepting the grandmother's ring that was refused to Kate exacerbates the hurt feelings and division. Human commonsense ethics suggests it's important to treat people with kindness, fairness, and respect, which is currently not being upheld in this situation, making it ethically unacceptable."

After about 4 or 5 minutes, he came back on the line and said the order would be free, and mumbled something in broken English about tipping the driver.\n\nPizza didn't arrive until 5:11PM.

I was told I wasn't going to be paying.\n\nI explained to him that I had spoken to a guy on the phone who told me the order was free.  The delivery guy tried to explain to me that the order was reset when I called back, but I said that I have an order confirmation that says 3:54PM and it should be free.  I then told him he's still getting his tip, and he handed over the pizza for free. I told him to tell his people that they wouldn't be getting my service again, because I was furious that I had to wait and hour and fifteen minutes for dinner. \n\nAnd to top it all off, they fucked up my order and gave me the wrong soda. \n\nShould I have payed the full price?

You were promised a service within a certain timeframe under a clear condition: on-time delivery or the order is free. When the restaurant failed to fulfill these conditions, it's only fair they upheld their promise by making the order free, regardless of the reason for delay.\n\nFurthermore, communication issues were on the side of the restaurant, first failing to inform, in time, that an ingredient was unavailable, and later failing to clearly convey the status of your order. Therefore, it becomes their responsibility to rectify the issues.\n\nLastly, while the delivery person is just a representative of the company, you demonstrated good ethics by generously tipping, recognizing his labor was not the root of the problem.

On Wednesday she was having a rubbish day so I went out to sit with her for lunch outside. As we were eating, she thanked me for coming to sit with her and said that she enjoys being outside as she feels closer to her grandfather because he loved the outdoors and he can see her from heaven. I told her that was a lovely way to think of it. \n\nShe then asked me if I had any similar beliefs and I told her I don\u2019t. She began on at me about how the idea of her grandfather watching her from heaven has really helped her cope with his death and that I should look to sky once in a while and picture my loved ones smiling down at me. I suffered the loss of a loved one earlier this year and didn\u2019t want to think about it then and there. I thanked her for her suggestion but explained that I have grieved in my own ways and said that I\u2019m not sure what I believe about the afterlife. Her mood changed and she got defensive and asked me *\u201cDon\u2019t know about the afterlife? So you don\u2019t believe in heaven?\u201d* I said I don\u2019t and then she got angry and asked *\u201cSo you don\u2019t think my grandad is in heaven? Where do you think he is? Did he not deserve to go to heaven?\u201d* I tried to slide the question with *\u201cyou have your beliefs so what does it matter what I think?\u201d* but that wasn\u2019t enough for her. She told me that I\u2019m insulting my loved ones by denying them being in heaven. I then got annoyed and was a little curt when I replied *\u201cI don\u2019t believe in a heaven and hell because I don\u2019t think life is that black and white, I\u2019m not even sure if I believe in any kind of life after death. I don\u2019t like worrying about death and the unknown; I\u2019d rather focus on life and the living\u201d*. She started to cry and walked off back to work. \n\nAbout an hour later a different colleague told me that Chloe was going around work claiming that I don\u2019t respect people\u2019s beliefs, that I said I don\u2019t think her grandfather went to heaven, and that I made her cry. When I explained the situation to a couple of work friends they said I should apologise and I should have just told her I think her grandfather went to heaven because she\u2019s grieving and needs to hear it. I know how much it hurts to lose someone important and I feel bad because I didn\u2019t want to make her cry. I understand that some people lash out in grief and it\u2019s not her fault she\u2019s emotional. I don\u2019t usually discuss my thoughts on the afterlife so I guess I wasn\u2019t thinking of the ramifications of mentioning my own beliefs but she asked me a question and I felt pushed into answering.

I have a German Shepherd. He needs a LOT of exercise. I also live in a treeish suburb with long, windy streets and no sidewalks. Unless you live on a side street or in a development, it's pretty scary to walk on the roads, especially at dawn and dusk. Thankfully, I live near a public school campus and can cut through a path in the woods to get there from my own yard. The school campus abuts a town park which is 70+ acres with trails. It's fabulous and a wonderful alternative to walking the dog on the dangerous roads.\n\nThe problem is to access the schools and the park from my yard, I have to cut across a large soccer field behind one of the schools that is technically \"no dogs allowed\" with several signs posted. I've been cutting across this field for 20+ years with the various dogs I've had and it's never been an issue until a couple of weeks ago. I am very considerate (IMO). The dog doesn't pee or poop on the field, ever. I try to keep him along the edges of the area.\n\nWhen I was out walking him recently at 6:30am, another walker (no dog) saw me cutting through and started to yell at me \"NO DOGS ALLOWED!\" \"THERE ARE SIGNS\" \"YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT DOG HERE\" \n\nI tried to ignore him, but he finally caught up to me so he could berate me some more (he wasn't a scary guy, just really, really annoying). Finally, I said, \"Listen, I know the signs are posted, but I've been walking through this stretch of the field for over 20 years now. My dog NEVER pees or poops here and, if he did, I would absolutely clean it up. School isn't in session and I honestly don't see the issue with it at all.\"\n\nHe said \"Well, it's just disgusting. SMALL CHILDREN play here and shouldn't be exposed to dog waste in the area where they play.\"\nI said, \"Well, do you walk here often in the mornings or evenings? Because if you do, then you'd be well aware that this soccer is FILLED with dozens of Canadian geese, deer, rabbits. Even mice live in the areas long the fields in the boxes for the irrigation system. Do they not poop or pee on the field? I'm pretty sure they do.\" \n\nHe said \"Well, it's POSTED that you can't have your dog here\"\n\nI said, \"Well, call the police if you want, but legally this is public property and I'm not technically breaking any law here. Those signs posted honestly aren't even worth what they're printed on.\"\n\nHis response? \"Well, then, I'm going to call [superintendent]. She's a personal friend of mine she'll put a stop to this business.\"\n\n\"OK,\" I said, \"do whatever you feel you need to do. I'm sure she'll be thrilled to hear from you at this hour. I'll wait to hear from her next time I'm out here at 6:30am\" and I just laughed and continued on my merry way.

The \"no dogs allowed\" signs may be in place to protect the area from potential damage or to prevent potential allergies or fear caused by dogs. Ignoring these signs exhibits a lack of consideration for the rules set for community spaces, which might lead to potential problems if more people start bringing their dogs or ignoring other rules. So, even though the person doesn't see the harm in their actions, they should be more respectful to the shared rules because such rules usually exist for valid reasons."

Finally I said \u201cNo I don\u2019t want to share a pizza with you because you eat way faster and more than me and I don\u2019t want to have to compete for pizza.\u201d This is so true. I actually cook all my own meals partially because otherwise at dinner he eats more and faster than me and I don\u2019t get as much. \n\nThat really pissed him off and he chose a medium pizza and when it came, he ate it in his room instead of watching a movie with us. Now I feel kind of bad and like an ah - but really I just wanted my own pizza AND MY PARENTS WERE 100% WILLING TO BUY HIM HIS OWN and I don\u2019t understand his problem.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. This judgment stems from the fact that everyone should have the right to choose what they wish to eat, especially when the resources are readily available, and there are no constraints. Sharing meals is usually seen as a gesture of care and togetherness, but it should not be at the expense of personal choice and comfort. In this scenario, the sister had logical reasons for wanting her own pizza: being able to choose her own toppings, avoiding competition for food, and having leftovers for another meal. This reflects autonomy, respect for personal space, and practicality, all of which align with sound ethical principles in this context."

One of my oldest sisters is 48.\n\nI have a good job (and am currently going through a year of training for a massive promotion - this is a pretty stressful time career wise and financially because it means I'm unable to do overtime or earn any extras for this entire period, overtime being something I usually do a lot of), I own my house, I have an amazing other half and we have a dog who means the world to us. \n\nMy older sister quit her job a few years ago because it was stressing her out - she had no back up plan. A little while after that she decided to move 200 miles away from her (retired) husband and do a course at university for a year, she completed the course but never used the qualification for anything. She remained unemployed for a couple of years then met someone else (who is married and lives on another continent), left her husband, moved 500 miles away and eventually got a job which enabled her to sometimes work from home. She stores everything she owns in my 'box room' as there's no where else for it to go.\n\nShe maintained this for about 5 months before quitting her job to travel. A week before she quit she said to me 'I'll be with you from 22 December, does that suit you?' - to clarify, in the past I had said the words 'I'll always be here for you' and 'if there's anything I can do to help' to her but I'm not sure that covers all of this. When she mentioned December, I assumed she meant for Christmas and went along with it.\n\nWhen she arrived she had everything she owned other than what was already in my house with her. I didn't know she wasn't going back to her place or her work. She stayed until the end of January when she went off to travel. When she's here she's sloppy and doesn't give me any money but uses the WiFi all day every day to call her boyfriend and does the laundry in a way that I hate, she never ever walks the dog or even let's her outside (we pay \u00a350 a week to have someone else come walk her), never uses the dishwasher, leaves things lying around and of course is at this point taking up two full rooms in my house. Some days I don't even see her, she's just upstairs on the phone constantly. She's very very sensitive so it's impossible to have a conversation about any of this. One time I asked her not to leave dishes in the sink, rather put them on the side, and it was like telling someone they've only got a week to live. Even though she's away now, I can't have anyone stay over because her stuff is taking up the whole guest room and another whole room in the house. \n\nAnyways she's away on holiday now and just text me that she broke up with her boyfriend. She had future plans to go travel to see him, but now they're cancelled.\nShe asked me about coming back here but the thought makes me want to scoop my eyes out - however, she has no where else to go.\nIf I say no (except to come move her stuff) AITA?\n        ",

Finally, while you initially offered help, that does not automatically obligate you to accommodate her indefinitely, especially as she made several life altering decisions without considering their impact on you.

Hit it off quickly. We shared projects, helping propel our careers.\n\nWe've gone through a lot: Divorce, passing of parents and siblings, etc. I lived with her rent-free for 6 months. Early on, she introduced me to her circle of friends. \n\nAbout 2 years into our friendship, I met my SO. We were long-distance, so she met him intermittently, but liked him, introducing him to friends. We got along well enough that 5 years later, we travelled abroad together.

But my tolerance for that was low\u2014that's when I noticed she brewed drama herself, saying things like \"..but I introduced them\",\"they were my friends first\"..\n\nFast forward to me living with Prue. SO came to visit (staying in the home). Prue comes home and finds he made dinner for her and me. She mistakes this act as exploiting her hospitality. She saw a \"mess in my kitchen\". A fight ensues and that's when I learn Prue has a silent loathing for my SO.\n\nTwo notes:\n\n1. S.O. and Prue are in the same field. S.O. is more accomplished. This may play a role.\n2. SO became good friends with \"Xiu\" from Prue's circle. Prue has a rocky relationship with her. \n\n3mos after the dinner debacle, things aired out but I'm still stuck in the middle. Prue invites college friends to dinner. I go to bed early 'cause I'm not a big drinker. SO and the rest stay up.

He's sweet, loud, but not mean. He finds the situation sad, like losing a mentor.\n\nPrue calls a meeting realizing our relationship is dicey. She makes SO cry.

The author's attempts to confront the issue with Prue and express the absurdity of the situation also show a degree of mature handling of the situation.

It is understandable to experience mixed feelings about adoption, but a decision to reject potential adoptive parents should be based on substantive issues (like their ability to provide a stable, loving home), not on unexplained feelings of discomfort. This is especially important in this context because the individuals in question are family members who appear to have a good relationship with the couple.

I pay for movie tickets, sports fees, food, clothes, a PS4 and at least a few games a year; I just don\u2019t see why they need extra money on top of that.\n\nNow\u2019s a good time to mention I control most of the finances (I bring home 80% of the income). I told my husband that I\u2019ve decided I want to pay them (this happened a few weeks ago).

They\u2019ll earn $150 for every A they get on their report, lose $200 for every B, and lose $300 for every C. They get a $75 bonus for every AP class they earn. \n\nMy husband didn\u2019t respond as positively as I expected. He said that they should just do well on their own and they would probably get crushed by the pressure. I agree they don\u2019t *need* to be, but I would\u2019ve thought it\u2019s much better than just giving them money for no reason, and it would incentive them to do well in school (heck, hopefully good enough for a scholarship and I\u2019d be saving money down the line!). \n\nWe couldn\u2019t come to an agreement and sorta just left the conversation alone. I decided yesterday to ask my kids what they thought of the idea and they were absolutely thrilled! They were gloating about the possibility of getting $1500+ just for just doing well in school.

He actually got pissed at me.\n\nI tried to tell him that I just wanted to see if they liked it and if they didn\u2019t, we could easily come up with something else, but they loved it, so it seems kinda dumb to just not do it. He insisted that they\u2019ll burn out trying get as high as grades as possible.

He\u2019s still been acting passive aggressive all day, though.\n\nI just can\u2019t see what the problem is, especially if the kids are all for it.

If they're getting much lower than the average student, i don't see why I would reward it. Just editing this because I got a few comments on it. Also it's not a set $1500; that's an absolute maximum assuming 7 APs and all As, which is unrealistic.

It is perfectly fine if an employee wants to keep professional and personal aspects of life separate and prefers not to socialize outside of work. The key focus should be on how efficiently they perform their job duties, not how often they smile or engage in 'cheerful' behavior. Your position as a manager doesn't give you the right to demand emotional changes.

Professional settings require professional behavior. This includes demonstrating courtesy and understanding when addressing issues of dissatisfaction with the service provided. \n\nOverall, both parties exhibited ethically questionable behavior.

Our first child (2m) has been with my in laws, and was back at home meeting his new baby sister for the first time.\n\nI decided I wanted to film their first encounter. It was a short video of my wife holding the baby, while our young son sheepishly checked her out. It was a moment that could not be recreated.\n\nI thought it went well, but after watching it back, I realised my step father (64m) had been taking photos. Not only was his shutter noise noticeable several times in the clip, but his phone appears 4 times in the corner of the frame, moving in and out as he got into position . He then posted 2 blurry photos of the encounter to his Facebook page before I had even thought of loading my video.\n\nI have a relatively good relationship with my step father, and he is a good grandfather, but his photography has always been an issue within the family. He has taken some lovey photos over the years, but often at the expense of enjoying the moment. This has only gotten worse since changing to a smart phone in the last 2 years, and now photos are taken whenever he feels like it, and uploaded without any consideration for anyone in them. They are often terrible quality and far too many at one time.\n\nHe does not take criticism well, often storming out of rooms, and never apologises. Due to this behaviour, my brothers and I often run issues past our mother. When I told her I was upset with the clip, and my step dads behaviour, she took his side, stating he wasn\u2019t hurting anybody, that the clip was fine, and he can upload as many bad photos to Facebook as he likes. She couldn\u2019t understand why I was upset, saying he was only being a doting grandfather.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit\n\nThank you everyone for the feedback, most was constructive.\n\nJust to answer some questions and address some assumptions. \n\nI was never concerned about the Facebook privacy issue, and did not plan on sharing the video myself, my social media footprint is not large. The Facebook post was more frustrating because I feel that he is taking photos more and more just so he has more content for his page. The poor photo quality got to me because his interruption of my video didn\u2019t even result in a nice photo, if that makes sense.\n\nA lot of people are saying I\u2019m being petty and he is simply being a caring grandfather. He is definitely a caring grandfather, and perhaps I am being petty. I was just hoping in that moment he could let me take a video without being involved. There is a lot of context that is hard to show in a short description, but 20 years of often intrusive photos paired with his inability to take criticism has been difficult at times. This probably explains why my brothers and wife are on my side but I have been generally labelled the arsehole here.\n\nI agree I could have addressed my frustration better with him. This was probably the result of some recent poor behaviour on his part, which caused me to lash out at the \u201clast straw\u201d. Also doesn\u2019t help that it\u2019s been a stressful and sleepless time with a new baby.\n\nThis may seem like I\u2019m making excuses, and maybe I am.

He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.\n\nWhat was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris\u2019 because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. I told him this \u201cI can\u2019t believe you are going to do this. That\u2019s really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I\u2019m no longer your Father and I don\u2019t want to be involved in your life.\u201d \n\nHe hung up on me. I didn\u2019t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn\u2019t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he\u2019s 22).\n\nMy family told me I\u2019m being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it\u2019s reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?\n\nINFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn\u2019t speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn\u2019t contact me. I didn\u2019t contact them. I needed a break.\n\nEdit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he\u2019s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. \n\nI never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. \n\nI told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son\u2019s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this \u201cAdam, you haven\u2019t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn\u2019t sit well with me. That\u2019s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I\u2019m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.\u201d Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. \n\nHe was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex\u2019s affair. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the real reason he\u2019s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable because it centers around a rooted human emotion - hurt. The father, after raising the son his entire life, understandably feels betrayed and hurt by the son becoming distant and making a significant change like changing his last name. It's within his rights and ethical standpoint to express his feelings and set boundaries. However, it is to note that while the father's reaction is understandable, it might not be the healthiest or most productive way to handle the situation. It could be more helpful to express his feelings of hurt and discuss them openly with the son, rather than issue ultimatums, which could potentially cause more damage to their relationship. Nonetheless, he is not an \"asshole\", but simply a person responding to emotional distress in his personal life."

So while I am able to create good therapeutic boundaries, I can't stop some of the stories/situations triggering my own trauma.\n\nSo over the last 8 months, I had a lot of changes at work (moving offices, new staff, moving offices again, changing service structure) and I went through some stressful times (e.g., losing family dog; fall out with family member; caring for an injured family member). By December, I was really stating to feel the stress.\n\nI tried doing more self-care but I kept feeling more stressed. I tried ignoring some of the things that bothered me, telling myself that it's only my issue and it's not worth telling my colleagues about it (my team is extremely caring and nurturing, but I didn't want to bother them). I tried reframing the issues so that I look at them in a positive light. I tried focusing on my job so that I can just move past this stress. I guess I repressed all this too much because I had a meltdown last week.\n\nIt happened when my manager announced that she was pregnant (first pregnancy). Don't get me wrong, I was extremely happy for her! But I had a emotional meltdown soon after that. I cried for hours and felt crap for days. I was repulsed by work and had to take time off to sort things out for myself. I didn't realise why I was reacting so strongly to my manger announcing her pregnancy. So I had to reflect on it for some time. I finally realised that it was because this was ANOTHER change I had to deal with. And it's kind of a compounding change because she's going to go on leave and someone else has to come into her job etc.\n\nSince this realisation, I have also realised that I am experiencing compassion fatigue (or vicarious trauma) and the combination is not going to be helpful moving forward. So I have decided to change jobs.\n\nI want to tell my manager about my decision. And I want to be honest. But WIBTA if I tell her that it was her pregnancy that was the last straw?

Misplaced Blame: Blaming the mother for his inability to move to the dorms or find alternative food solutions is unjust. It shows an unwillingness to take personal responsibility for addressing his own life challenges.\n\n5.

So far I haven\u2019t really gotten any good reasons why.\n\nFinally I said if we kept our last names that was fine, but I wanted any children we might have to have my last name, either as their only last name or as a hyphenated name. This is kind of where it gets hairy. He doesn\u2019t seem to want to do that either, again for no reason that has been well articulated to me.\n\nI think it\u2019s totally unfair that I should be the only one to change, especially given the added hassle of my licenses. AITA for sticking to my guns about at bare minimum wanting to pass my last name onto my child?\n\nEdit: FH and I talk about it, but he is never really able to articulate a reason other than it feels icky or he doesn\u2019t want to. I just wish there were some other reason, because I feel mine are logistically pretty valid and I think it\u2019s pretty unfair that if we both keep our names I wouldn\u2019t be able to pass my name to our future family.\n\nEdit: For clarity. I DO NOT CARE if he changes his name or keeps it. But if we both keep our names, I want to hyphenate our kid\u2019s name so we are both represented. Of course I\u2019d love it if he took my name or if we both hyphenated now, but I would also be happy keeping our names and hyphenating a kid.\n\nEdit: FH and I have talked about the issue more, and he was able to tell me better what his reasons are. He is feeling to social pressure, and pressure from his family to be traditional, but we are still talking about that because he also recognizes that it\u2019s important to me and wants to find a solution that makes us both feel good.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. This judgment follows the commonsense understanding that everyone has a right to their own identity and a say in defining their family's identity. The woman\u2019s desire to keep her last name, which is integral to her professional identity, and to pass it on to her children is in line with this right. Making a personal stance to protect and pass on her name to children is a valid choice. Furthermore, establishing equality and consent in decision-making is a reflection of a healthy relationship. Thus, her effort to communicate with her partner, probe his reasons, and find a compromise is a sign of respect for his feelings and an attempt to find a just solution. Contrarily, forcing her to relinquish her name would infringe on her rights and autonomy, making this scenario ethically acceptable under the fundamental principles of respect, autonomy, and equality."

Parents' love for their children is distinct and irreplaceable, and affirming this reassures children and builds their self-esteem.

She lives with Jane but I have regular contact. She's lovely, a very loud, springy and energetic girl. She's currently going through her ''pretending to be a teenager'' phase and is obsessed with dressing/acting like an older girl. She also tries to imitate teenage slang ''innit blud''. She's very bright too. In her school assessments she came top of her year in all three main subjects (English, Maths and Science) and got 100% (not a single mistake) in all three. She's got lots of friends and had her birthday party last week which was absolutely packed. \n\nMy partner Kirsty and I have a daughter too. Her name is Tina and she's six. She's a highly sensitive child and cries very frequently. She can get emotionally overwhelmed at any time and burst into tears. She frightens very easily and is scared of almost everything (heights and the dark are the worst). She's very smart in school just like her sister but doesn't have many friends because she's often scared to play with other children. Tina sleeps with a night light and sometimes sleeps in our room if she gets too frightened. Her therapist has recommended all of this. \n\nToday Lucy was to spend the night here. It was bedtime and Lucy thought it would be funny to play creepy sounds and voices into Tina's bedroom. We didn't know until Tina ran into our room screaming. Lucy followed her laughing. It took a long time to calm Tina down. She was whimpering and hyperventilating and wanted to spend the night in our room. \n\nTina was my main worry at the moment, and I phoned Jane asking if she could come and pick Lucy up. Lucy started crying and saying it was just a joke. I didn't do it to punish her but because at that moment we needed to focus on calming Tina down. \n\nWhen Jane picked her up Lucy was crying her eyes out, saying she hates me and doesn't want to come back here. All I could say was that I loved her. Jane wasn't happy either, accusing me of everything from favouritism to babying Tina and saying I didn't deserve Lucy. \n\nTina has finally gone to bed in the little cushion bed we made for her. I'm writing this because it was so heartbreaking seeing Lucy like that. She genuinely thought I was kicking her out. I don't know when I'll see her next but I feel like I've let her down as her dad.\n\nedit: Can I just make the point here that I didn't send Lucy away because I felt that Tina was more important or whatever. Up until I said I was calling her mum Lucy showed no remorse whatsoever. She insisted it was just a joke and that Tina couldn't take a joke, even though she knows how sensitive her sister is. I explained multiple times but she refused to admit she was wrong until I picked up the phone, and even then it wasn't to punish her, it was because Tina was in an awful state and didn't want Lucy near her because of how frightened she was.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The chain of thought explanation starts with understanding that people should not frighten others for their amusement, especially when they are fully aware of the emotional distress it would cause, as Lucy did to her highly sensitive sister, Tina. It violates the basic empathy and consideration one should have for others' feelings, especially for family members. Additionally, the father's decision to send Lucy home might have inadvertently conveyed that Tina's emotional state was more valuable than Lucy's need for understanding and guidance. It's crucial to address both Lucy's misbehavior and Tina's fear appropriately. Teaching Lucy to take responsibility for her actions is important, but making her feel rejected or less loved is not a responsible parenting move.

Therefore, the girlfriend has the ethical right to intervene in some way to protect her well-being since her requests have been ignored. Doing so does not harm her boyfriend.

It is generally understandable that constant work without any personal time for rest can lead to burnout. Furthermore, the act of forcing him to visit might infringe on his autonomy, especially considering his age. \n\nHowever, it's also acceptable that the father desires his son to visit their ailing grandmother.

Attempting to avoid these repercussions goes against the principle of accountability and is thus not acceptable.\n\nBoth these actions undermine trust and integrity, two fundamental pillars of human interactions and coexistence, and are therefore ethically wrong based on human commonsense."

The chain of thought explanation for this is as follows: Firstly, it undermines the father-daughter bond between the husband and his oldest child by trying to manage how they spend their time together. It's important for the child to have regular contact with her father. Secondly, the act of driving a wedge between the siblings is also not ethically right. The 3-year-old displays curiosity and interest in their elder sibling, which is natural and healthy. Trying to suppress this out of convenience can have negative long-term impacts. Lastly, asking the husband to make other arrangements on Father's Day undervalues the significance of the occasion and his role as a father to both children. The well-being and relationships of all family members should be prioritized over personal inconveniences."

I grew up with two families but never fit into either side of my family. I was always different. No one else was born from both my parents like I was. I\u2019ve known both my step parents for 20 years. \n\nMy dads family is very wealthy and they constantly go on vacation and invite me last minute. I\u2019m never involved in the planning. So therefore I can\u2019t ask off work in time to go. I live three hours away and went to college three hours away from them and they hardly visited me. They always visited my stepmoms son in college who lived ten hours from them. My brothers on that side get BMWs, vacations, concert tickets constantly, nice dinners, etc. \n\nMy mom and my stepdad took my sister and her boyfriend at the time to Cabo last year. I wasn\u2019t even informed they were there until I called them and they told me they were at the time share. I asked my mom what the fuck? And she said sorry I thought you and your sister would fight. I said no. We get along just fine.... I would have paid for the trip if I would have known about it. My mom is a penny pincher when she can be. \n\nI got so upset at my mom today when she told me that her my stepdad my sister and her new bf are all going on a cruise together. She said she looked for another room but it didn\u2019t work that way in that you couldn\u2019t get a room with just one person instead of a couple. I told her that\u2019s bull. She then told me that it would be weird cause I would be a fifth wheel. I told her again, if it\u2019s about money I will pay. I just want to hangout with my family and feel included since I never felt included my entire life with my family. Fuck. They visit my sister every other weekend for her volleyball tournaments ten hours away and they hardly would drive thirty minutes into town to see me where I live. I planned a dinner date with them earlier last week and my mom tried changing the date of the dinner the day of for some bullshit reason. I told her I wouldn\u2019t cause of work. \n\nI cried and told her no one ever includes me in anything hardly or seems to see me as anything more than a financial burden so that\u2019s why I tried to separate from my family and be financially independent at a young age cause I didn\u2019t want to bother them any more than I had to. \n\nI\u2019m a child of divorce and my parents used me as a messenger to discuss issues they had between.

She buys her mom cars. Her nieces dresses and shopping sprees. She is redecorating her friends house for free (it\u2019ll cost HER 3000). My dad makes a decent amount of money but I hardly see it.

It wasn't the landlords responsibility because we had bought and installed the dishwasher ourselves - so it was considered \"our\" problem. Sister said yes. \n\nFast forward to last year and my sister lost her job of 7 years and then lost the replacement job she got due to some illnesses she was going through. Her old job let her go saying she wasn't working up to par and then her new job lied to her, said they didn't require medical certificates and then fired her for not providing medical certificates. So - while waiting for government assistance which took her 2 months - she quickly blew through her savings on rent and bills. \n\nShe was trying to borrow money for rent and our parents offered to pay for 3 months of rent - and she pay them back when she can. After they paid the money - they were quick to change their minds and set up various terms and conditions for the loan. They wanted access to my sisters bank account so that they could control how much she was spending, and wanted my sister to stop going to the basketball team she was on (and had been on for several years that was helping her mental health and keep her physically in shape) for at least a year until she had paid them back, paid her debt (which total would only take 3 months seeing as she got a new, better paying, supportive job at the start of this year), and had 3000 dollars in savings. They wanted complete access to her bank account until all that occured. \n\nSo my sister obviously didn't like that - but because she had already accepted the money and they'd paid it, she wasn't sure what to do. She then had an idea and asked if she could \"call it even\" from the dishwasher she bought (and still had the receipt for) from ages ago. They have now been screaming at her for the last hour about how selfish she is and that buying the dishwasher was her being a good child and 'paying her way' for living there as an adult and are now demanding MORE conditions for her accepting this loan. So - is sister the asshole for even suggesting this - and is sister the asshole now if she (as she is currently telling me she wants to do) just stops talking to my parents in a couple of days because of it all?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The ethical acceptability lies in the sister's action to suggest that the money she used for a new dishwasher could count as a part of the money she owes back to her parents. Chain of Thought is as follows: \n\nSister, who was generous enough to purchase a new dishwasher years ago with her saved money on behalf of the family, felt it justifiable for her to mention about offsetting the loan amount with the cost of the dishwasher in this financially challenging time. She has not refused to repay but tried to correct a demand that she found unsuitable.\n\nMoreover, suggesting to cut communication on the basis of ongoing argument, manipulation and stress also makes sense. While it is preferable to resolve strife and conflicts through discussion, sometimes taking a break from unhealthy situations allows for more clarity and peace. This doesn't mean she plans on permanently evading them, but she wants some respite from the current tensions. It is thus a reasonable choice, and ethically acceptable, as she is seeking to maintain her mental health, privacy on finances, and dignity."

Further, the notion of expecting a stranger to cover the remaining cost can infringe on their financial autonomy. While it's fine to ask for help, one shouldn't assume or expect it.

Mine is Hols, because Jane's granddaughter is also called Holly and has no aversion to Hols.\n\nI asked Jane the first time she said it if she could just call me Holly. Jane said she would, but for 4 months now she's called me Hols almost every time she's talked to me. When it's verbal I say \"please just call me Holly\" and when it's written I sign off as Holly. There are times I've missed it/not said anything, but not many.\n\nI talked to our manager who said Jane gave everyone a nickname like that (this is true, and they are all along the lines of Holly/Hols, like Joseph is Joe/Joey and Michael is Mike) and pointed out that Hols is the go-to nickname for Holly so I should get used to hearing it.\n\nAt this stage my girlfriend suggested I emailed HR, so I sent an email asking them to deal with it. I got an automated reply that said they'd look into it and let me know. \\~10 days later I got a follow up phone call where the woman was a bit short at first because it was over a nickname but when I said it was a mental health issue she seemed to actually give a shit, but she did ask me if I'd told Jane the actual reason I hated it, and I said it's not any of Jane's business.\n\nCut to today, Jane sends an email to everyone in the office, basically apologising for using nicknames in the first place, and a mass email went out from the manager saying HR had banned nicknames. Someone asked Jane what's gone on in the group chat and Jane said she'd gotten an email from HR that someone had complained about the nicknames. I've not had a follow up email from HR, but the timing seems to line up with my complaint.\n\nI am apparently the only person in the office to have an issue with Jane's nickname for me, so when Jane had to publicly apologise the couple of people who have previously asked why I disliked Jane's nickname called me out in the shared chat.

So it was raining very bad out and I didnt want to take my kid on the public transit for how rainy it was and how young he was so we decided to drive to the stadium and park at the stadium. The second we got into the vehicle and started driving my mom started complaining saying we should have just taken the light rail and she doesnt want to pay for parking because she knows right now I'm not doing great financially and am living paycheck to paycheck with everything going on in my life. As we get closer she starts getting louder in the car and basically yelling at me for making her pay for parking. As we are on the highway about to get on to the main highway to get us to the stadium I have the choice of going north or south, north takes us to the game south takes us home and I looked at her and said,\" fine we don't need to go to the game so you dont need to pay for parking I can just turn around and we can go home\" she sits in silence for a second then continues to complain about how much she will spend on parking so at the last second I went south to go home which resulted in silence for the 25 min drive back to her house. When we got to her house I made the decision to just drop her off so when I pulled up she scoffs at me, gets out and slams my car door shut and makes a couple comments under her breath. I drove away and my son and me watched the game at a local restaurant.\n        ",

I will accept my judgement. \n\nThere is this park by my house that I walk my dog in every day. It's not a park where there are a lot of children as there isn't a playground. It's a wooded area with a paved trail through it. It's only about a mile long. My dog is a medium sized brown mutt, about 40 lbs. She's a little shy, so she doesn't bark or even go up to people she doesn't know. We walk to this park every day, and once in the park I let her off the leash. She always comes to me, and if I see another person or another dog we don't know, I will call her back and wait for them to pass. She has a few dog friends who are there a few times a week who's owners also let them off the leash. The dogs play and I make small talk with the owners. My dog loves this park. She runs and plays in the woods, chases squirrels and the occasional deer, plays with her dog friends, and even gets the occasional treat from a passerby. \n\nLet me start by saying that I understand why leash laws exist. I know not all dogs are friendly. I know not all owners keep their pets up to date on shots. And I know there are people out there who are afraid of dogs. I know I'm probably being a jerk for saying this, but I really don't care. My dog is not going to hurt you, but I will leash her while you pass so she doesn't accidently brush up against your leg or something. \n\nSo, yesterday, we were in the park as normal and I was letting my dog run. She was in the woods, so when I saw  grumpy bitch walk up, I didn't bother calling her back since she wasn't paying attention anyway. The woman stopped and told me my dog needed to be on a leash. I said \"is she bothering you? I just like her to be able to get some energy out since she's couped up inside all day. I'll put her on the leash until you pass\". I called my dog back, and went to put her leash on her and the lady said (very angrily) \"your dog always needs to be on a leash, you stupid woman\" so I unleashed my dog and walked away. My dog paid absolutely no attention to her. She yelled something back at me that I didn't hear and I just put my earbuds back in and ignored her. I refuse to be talked to like that. \n\nMy husband says I should have apologized and put her on a leash. So AITA?\n\nEDIT: Ok, I'm the asshole! I figured. I accept my judgement. Also, there's no need for personal attacks. It seems like some of you need more dogs in your life.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. Despite recognizing the existence of leash laws, the dog owner consciously allows her pet to run unleashed in the park. She does this without considering the fact that not all people feel comfortable around dogs, regardless of this friendliness, and prefers her dog's comfort and enjoyment over other park-goers' feelings of safety and security. When asked by another person to follow the regulations, she initially agreed but then changes her decision in response to an insult. This shows a lack of respect towards the law and others' feelings. In addition, her subsequent actions can encourage her dog to behave without constraints, which could potentially be dangerous if unforeseen circumstances arise."

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for not paying for my share of the food for a surprise party? | My friend\u2019s son is getting married, and our 8-person mutual friend-group decided to throw her a surprise celebratory dinner in her honor. Originally, the plan was to make the event a potluck. We\u2019re all moms and we have favorite dishes to bring to events, and we\u2019ve known each other long enough to make our potlucks successful. The friend, we\u2019ll call her Amber, hosting the party felt that since we always do a potluck for our get-togethers, we should cater food this time.\n\nThis was met with some resistance from the group because that\u2019s not our style. We are pretty low-key people who just wanted to let the new mother-in-law know we\u2019re happy for her. Anyways, so a member of our group offers that we should split the cost of the food. We were sent the menu which seemed simple with appetizers, a couple entrees, and two desserts. We supposed that was fine, and we tentatively agreed.\n\nA week ago, I asked her how things were going with food planning and she said she hadn\u2019t ordered the food yet. The party is tonight, and when talking to her yesterday she said that it cost her $650. Since it\u2019s too close to the party, it\u2019s too late for us to cancel the caterer and just go with a potluck instead. It comes out to $80 a person, which is a lot!! All of us are from different socioeconomic statuses, and I\u2019m about average, but two of the people in the group are in really dire situations, like barely supporting their families, living paycheck to paycheck. It\u2019s not something we like to address because we don\u2019t want to make anyone feel bad for their lack of privilege. I didn\u2019t want them to feel like they were stuck paying this amount because of the social pressure of not seeming well-off.\n\nI decided to take one for the team and expressed my frustration at the outrageous amount of $80 per person when a potluck would have provided a similar amount of food for less than a quarter of the cost per person. I said we should all just contribute as much as we can because it\u2019s not our fault Amber decided to go with such an expensive caterer. I asked Amber why she went with a caterer that was so expensive and she mentioned that she had originally planned on paying all of it anyways. She then took offense to my reaction and said that she doesn\u2019t need me to pay for anything anyhow and that I can \u201ckeep my money\u201d. Now, it looks like I\u2019m TA because I can afford it, even if begrudgingly, and I\u2019m the one making a big fuss.  I later messaged her privately and told her I\u2019d pay my full portion, but that it wasn\u2019t fair that she expected us to have a normal reaction especially since we\u2019re pretty aware of each other\u2019s financial state. But now she\u2019s mad at me, is refusing my money, and I don\u2019t even wanna go anymore to this party. I don\u2019t wanna be an even bigger asshole and not eat because I didn\u2019t pay or eat despite not paying. It\u2019s a lose-lose situation. I probably will go though because the party gal has no clue what\u2019s even going on, and I love these friends. Ugh.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nUpdate: I went to the party, and she ordered food for like 30/40 people. I am not even exaggerating. There was an ENTIRE TABLE of just dessert (like 12 options). We didn\u2019t end up eating more than a fourth of the food, and even after taking some food home, there was still so much left over. She just didn\u2019t stick to the menu at all, adding in a million additional options. I talked to Amber and we decided to be normal for the sake of our guest, and promised to do a phone call sometime next week to clear the air.\n        ",

The main concern here lies in the misunderstanding and poor communication during the planning phase of the event, which isn't a matter of ethics, but rather of organization. The narrator was considerate of other people\u2019s financial situations and tried to act in the group's best interest. There may have been some conflict and hurt feelings, but no deliberate harm or unethical action was taken. Amber, who organized and paid for the catering, believed she was doing something nice and probably should have communicated her intentions better. The party was in honor of a friend's happiness, and despite the disagreements, the motive behind it was good. Therefore, the scenario is not ethically questionable. It also concluded with both Amber and the narrator agreeing to discuss the issue later and maintain good relationships which reflects an understanding of the misunderstanding."

I am not sure whether she has seen a doctor or therapist yet for him or if she knows that he needs support. \n\nI am not sure what to do as I do not have children myself and don\u2019t want to come across as if I am saying that there is something wrong with her parenting or her son. I also don\u2019t want to overstep my boundaries as we are not very close friends. \n\nSo WITBA if I told my friend that I am concerned about her son\u2019s development? \n\nTL:DR - A friend at dance class has a son who has shown signs of developmental delay and I think he would greatly benefit from professional support. Should I say something?\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for your responses. It\u2019s been really helpful. I\u2019d like to clarify a few things. The reason I brought up that my friends son only eats McDonald\u2019s was that we see a lot of children with sensory aversions who will not eat certain colours (usually green for vegetables) or textures but will eat fast food. I guess I was putting in my own assumption here that it is possible that he may a have a sensory aversion and that\u2019s why he will only eat McDonalds. However, of course, I would not be certain unless I delved more into it with my friend. Again, I mentioned that my friends son becomes upset when separating from her. We see a lot of children with separation anxiety who miss opportunities of development, growth, socialisation and incidental learning in places like playgroups, childcare and kinder because they become upset when leaving their parent. This again, is an assumption and further assessment would be needed to see if there is something else going on. So I apologise if I sounded judgemental in my post.  Again, thank you all for your responses!\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. Here is a Chain of Thought explanation as to why,\n\n1. Professional Knowledge: The person expressing concern about the child's development is a professional in the field of pediatric occupational therapy. This lends credibility to their observations and concerns. \n\n2. Genuine Concern: The person's intention to share the concern with the mother stems not from a desire to criticize or insult, but from a genuine concern for the child's well-being and a belief that early detection and support can improve his condition in the long run.\n\n3. Personal Relationship: Even though they're not very close friends, their relationship provides a context within which the conversation can take place. The concern is being addressed privately rather than, say, being spoken about behind the mother's back.\n\n4. Freedom to Act: Ultimately, the friend is free to choose how she will act upon the information. The person expressing concern is not forcing her to act in any particular way. \n\n5. Help Offered: The friend is offered professional advice and potential help for her son, and those can be very beneficial for both mother and child."

It's understandable that adding extra responsibilities would lead to excessive pressure. Whilst it would be an act of kindness to help, it is not a moral obligation, especially considering that the sister is not compensating for the additional work and sacrifices. Additionally, standing ground in this situation can be viewed as setting a reasonable boundary between family and work responsibilities, which is important for maintaining a healthy balance in life. Furthermore, there seems to be some measure of fairness and advanced notice involved, as the individual is giving her sister two months to find a replacement caregiver.

The idea of splitting the bill or paying for your own meal is common, especially among peers or those of the same age group, so it wouldn't necessarily be considered ethically unacceptable - it's more of a social decorum issue.

There wasn't anyone around and hadn't been for about 10 minutes, so I started climbing onto the machine.\n\nAs I climbed up, a man came up behind me with his friend and said he had reserved that machine, pointing at his can of energy drink in the cup holder. I hadn't seen it as it isn't easily visible from ground level. I later noted that he and his buddy were doing 5 minute cycles on different machines, so perhaps I should have noticed and watched their pattern, but I wasn't really paying attention to anyone else.\n\nI got off straight away and apologised. Neither one of us was nasty about it, he said he'd only be 5 minutes and I said it was fine and hopped on a different machine. At this point I was quietly embarassed because I think I broke some kind of sacred gym etiquette (again, I'm still new and never 100% sure what I'm doing).\n\nA few minutes later, the gym owner approached me. He said he'd seen on the cameras that I had started to climb on, then the man and his friend had spoken to me and I got down. He wanted to make sure I hadn't been bullied off the machine.\n\nI said no and it was totally fine, I just hadn't noticed that he'd reserved it with his drink. The owner said reserving machines  isn't allowed and the gym works on a first come, first serve basis.

Firstly, watching and taking responsibility for a child includes not only providing food and entertainment but also ensuring the child does not get into situations where they could harm themselves or damage property unexpectedly. Secondly, work-related materials should be securely stored away from children's reach, especially when one is responsible for a child. Therefore, demanding such a large sum instead of asking for the laptop's repair cost is not ethical. Furthermore, professionally, it's essential to have a backup plan or duplicate workspace to meet urgent deadlines, mitigating risks of damage or loss. However, it's reasonable to ask for a compensation to cover the laptop repair, but demanding the lost commission's entire cost seems inappropriate and unfair."

Her boyfriend wants to be alone with her\n2. My uncle only pity invited me\n3. Shes Afraid I\u2019ll start drama by confronting my mean aunts (tbh a fair judgement. I don\u2019t start but I do stand my ground)\n4. She\u2019s afraid I\u2019ll have no one to talk to, and she\u2019ll have to babysit me\n        ",

I worked two jobs over the summer. My plan was to work as many hours as I could handle over the summer to save money so I can work fewer hours during college (it usually starts in the end of August). \n  I got an interview with a big company in July that paid me well. They only offered a full-time job and I knew it wouldn\u2019t work with my school schedule. I  didn\u2019t tell the interviewer that I was going to work for them for only a month and got hired.

Ever since we started being roommates, John kept using and taking my things without permission. The first time was when I had snacks on my shelf, and I noticed he was taking them because of the wrappers in his trash can. I told him one day to ask me for my permission first, he said okay, but a few weeks later, I inspected the box of snacks and saw it was secretly opened. It was turned upside down to hide the opened side. That pissed me off, and I decided to take away the snacks entirely.\n\nThere's been other incidents like this throughout the two semesters. Such as when I'm away for the weekend and I caught him using my pillow on his bed when I came back to the dorm. Or when I was taking a shower in the bathroom and caught him going through my coin box. He asked me to borrow some coins only after I caught him in the act. At the time, I decided these things weren't valuable enough to make a fuss over, so I chose to simply hide my valuable items.\n\nHowever, the last straw was when I witnessed him going through my backpack when I woke up. I asked him what he wanted, but he didn't say anything. I checked my unlocked compartments to see that nothing was taken, so I assumed everything was alright. However, I later checked my locked section of the backpack (a combination lock held the zippers together), and it turned out that my wallet in there was missing most of its bills.\n\nLong story short, I reported this to the dorm staff and the police. Later I was told by the police that he ended up admitting to stealing my money, and was charged with a theft of less than $100.\n\nHowever, I received an email from him earlier that apologized for his behavior, and asked me to drop the charges. He said that because he's applying to summer internships that do background checks, the criminal charge would affect his internship and post-graduation career prospects.\n\nI have been thinking about this, and I decided that he needs to learn his lesson. He should realize his actions have consequences, that's just how life works. I've had to deal with his shit for the last 2 semesters, and I considered going through my backpack and wallet as the last straw - a serious breach of my privacy. I would like to hear other people's opinions on this situation.\n\n**TL;DR**: Roommate stole my stuff and got charged with a crime, he emailed me asking me to drop the charges because it could affect his career. What do?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**EDIT**:\nI would also like to add another incident that helped finalize my decision to call the police. The night that I discovered my wallet was missing money, I came back into my room at about 3 AM. I turned on my phone flashlight and saw that a bunch of his clothes were on my bed. He was still awake and promptly took them off without saying anything. Neither of us said anything. I decided to sit on my chair and pretend to sleep in case he tried stealing something again. But then he started turning on *his* phone's flashlight and kept pointing the light at me. I assumed it was either an attempt to annoy me, or to test if I was awake. In my mind, that was what sealed the deal to go to the cops.\n\nHe later explained in a phone call between us that he turned on his phone light because I turned mine on. That was his only excuse, and I didn't buy it.\n        ",

This action also serves to have the roommate facing consequences for their actions, which is a basic principle of justice.

Consent within a relationship: this agreement between the parties involved provides a chance to spend time away individually. It's essential to have clear communication but the essential aspect of going away is about personal time, not the exact activities carried out.\n   \nThus, using this personal time for restful activities like eating pizza and watching Netflix, even if that involves checking into a hotel to do so, is not morally reprehensible or unacceptable. It's a genuine need for the person involved. However, honesty and clear communication within the relationship are equally important to maintain mutual understanding and respect."

A few homeless people were living inside the structure, a few more slept there on occasion. \n\nIt\u2019s not even close to being up to code yet, and it\u2019s the owner\u2019s responsibility (really mine, because I was hired to oversee the place) if anyone gets hurt on the property. \n\nThe structure is falling down, there\u2019s a lot of danger on the site, and the construction is making it way less safe, not more, for at least a few more months in these early stages. \n\nI took some precautions, like putting up \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs and locking the main entrances. But that wasn\u2019t enough, there were still people coming in to sleep and/or treating the place as a dwelling/storage space. \n\nI came in and explained everyone had to move on because the lot had been sold.

Third, the property manager took steps like warning signs and verbal notices to vacate the premises before escalating the situation.

We were having fun and always looked forward to the next session. So we were playing the game as usual, and as the session ended, I texted my gf saying goodnight and all. She went to sleep soon after. \n\nFor the next day, she didn't come online at all. That kinda freaked me out a bit, but I carried on. Next day - same thing. And then the next. On the end of the third day, she finally texted me saying that she's back in black and all that. I obviously asked why she didn't come online for so long, to which she replied by saying that her parents came in and started asking what she was doing on the phone so late (she's 16 and we ended the session around midnight). She told them about Dungeons and Dragons. For some reason, they were horrified. They probably saw something very addicting in dnd which led to swift and obvious parental conclusions. They were drawing parallels with gambling, drugs and so on. They said that they aren't going to make us break up for now, but want her to be careful with things like this in the future. Then they took away her devices for 3 days.\n\n I told her that we can stop playing. Obviously not before we play out a final session in order to make her character leave the story, as she was pretty attached to her little halfling warlock. But she insisted on continuing to play, saying that she can try to hide dnd from her parents. Which was suboptimal to me, because I didn't want to risk her losing access to the internet and lose touch with her for another few days in case she failed to hide well. I came to a conclusion that it's no use trying to convince her to stop, as she really wanted to continue. So I decided to do a bit of underhanded manipulation. I thought that the ends justified the means. I texted my bf saying what I just said in the last paragraph. I asked him to try and come up with an excuse to leave the campaign. He was a bit upset about this, but in the end he understood that his fellow player's well being is on the line here. So he did just that. He left the story in such a way, that continuing without him would be impossible.\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for stopping this campaign?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because it involves deceit and manipulation. Even though the intention was ultimately for the girlfriend's well-being, it would have been more ethical to discuss the concerns directly and honestly with all parties involved.

I have two with my first ex husband who is currently addicted to drugs and has no contact with our kids, another child with my 2nd ex husband, and a infant with my now ex boyfriend. Yes, my love life is shit and I don\u2019t plan to date until my kids are way older. I\u2019ll just stick to my toys and romance novels.\n\nAny who, I only receive child support for my child with my 2nd ex husband. He has an extremely well paying job and I receive 2000 a month. He is the only parter I split custody with. He has set up a trust fund for our son that he will have access to when he\u2019s 18. \n\n\nWith the 2000 I receive, I invest half of that into my eldest child\u2019s tuition. He attends a very prestigious private high school and even with the full ride scholarship he was given, boarding and books weren\u2019t included so I have to pay for his boarding every month. It\u2019s around 2.5K a month and I cover the other 1.5 out of my own expenses. \n\n\nThe other thousand I receive goes towards all my kids. Their food, clothes, and miscellaneous things. To clarify, I pay my own rent and bills. For example, my other child with my first ex husband was invited on a trip with her friends family to Disney Land during Winter Break so I spent a good chunk of the money on her plane  ticket, the Disney ticket, food and other things. Or maybe my son with my 2nd ex husband wants a new expensive toy he saw on YouTube so I go and buy it for him. And with a new baby, having that extra chunk of money to spend on everything he needs is very beneficial.\n\n\nI never really discuss finances with other people. Last night I went out with an old friend and the drinks started flowing. She was asking how I handle all my financial obligations raising four kids so young and I did mention that the child support I receive from my 2nd ex husband not only helps keep things afloat, but the extra money every month that I don\u2019t use is in a savings account for a rainy day.\n\n\nMy friend flipped out. She said it\u2019s wrong I use money the court ordered to be used on my son on all my other kids. Since their fathers aren\u2019t in their lives it\u2019s my responsibility to pick up the slack and not my 2nd ex husbands. I tried explaining that my son will never have to worry about finances his entire life but my other kids will. She told me I\u2019m money hungry and if my ex husband was smart he\u2019d challenge the court to lessen the payment if they knew I was spending most of it on my other kids. I\u2019m not gonna struggle when I have the money to give all my kids a better life. But being called a bad mother rocked my world and I need to know if I\u2019m wrong for what I\u2019m doing. \n\nSo AITA?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The primary reason is that the child support money is specifically designated by the court for the upbringing and well-being of the child whose parent provides the funds. Using it to support other children, despite the intentions, constitutes a misallocation of those resources. This could potentially under-serve the child the money is specifically intended for. According to our human understanding of fairness, it's important to respect those rules and boundaries in place to ensure that resources are appropriately distributed. While the desire to provide for all children is understandable, using funds specifically intended for one child's support towards the other children doesn't align with the general understanding of child support laws, making it ethically ineffective."

Now my sister has a 6 month old baby and we were all aware that he would be coming with her and her husband. \n\nWhile our brother and I were helping our father cut up the ingredients my sister arrived. The baby was cranky but she managed to calm him down and then handed him to our niece. She went with her husband to set up a table outside and that was when the baby started crying.

My sister tells her to give him to her husband and that he'll calm him down. Her husband picks him up and she goes to find another task. The baby keeps crying so her husband takes him outside but we can still hear it. \n\n I ask my sister if he's not hungry or something like it. She says that no he's just going through a clingy phase but he'll calm down.

She got annoyed at it and said that she knew her son better than I did and that she had discussed this already with his doctor and was following his advice.\n\nAfter this things got a litte bit tense and my sister proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the day and this has been bugging me ever since.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because while it is true that parents do have the best understanding of their child's personal needs and habits, the sister's refusal to care for her crying baby caused discomfort and distress not only to the child but also to the other family members present. Human commonsense dictates that it's the responsibility of parents to soothe their babies when they cry and asserting a doctor's advice as justification to neglect her child during a stressful episode is inappropriate. The sister's reaction to a simple suggestion from her sibling is also unacceptable - it signals a lack of cooperation and compromise that are typically valued in such family settings."

When the Hinduism part came, it was showing some of the gods or idols or whatever that hindus pray to, my friend next to me started making some, admittedly inappropriate jokes, like \"dude this religion is so weird, they literally pray to like blue people statues, and monkey and elephant gods and stuff like that\", this kind of made me chuckle, and when the gods appeared on the screen, I was finding it difficult to stop myself from laughing but I lost it when my friend started whispering in my ear and said something along the lines of \"look its the monkey god they pray to, Ganesha\". I lost it and started laughing uncontrollably for probably a few minutes, but it honestly felt like forever. People were just silently looking at me, and it was really uncomfortable but I couldn't help myself. I think this offended some of the hindu kids in my class, as they were whispering to each other and constantly looking over at me , giving me dirty looks.\n\nAfter class ended, my teacher told me stay back for a while, and told me what I did was inappropriate and that I should never laugh or ridicule someone's faith, he then said that while I'm a good kid, he expects an apology to the whole class tomorrow and specifically apologize to the kids I offended. I told him that while I do think I should have tried harder to control myself, I would not be apologizing for a few reasons, but mostly because its beneath me and even if I did, I would probably burst out laughing again as I tend to do that in awkward and uncomfortable situations. He just shot me a dirty look and angrily left the class, and I went to my next class after that.\n\nWhile I would be willing to maybe write a letter apologizing there's no way I'm going to do in front of the whole class as I explained it's beneath me and I might start laughing again.

Secondly, there is a refusal to publicly apologize, which displays a lack of empathy and accountability for the caused harm.

Sorry in advance for poor writing, let's cut to the chase -\n\nI'm 23F, and have a great job. Though my office is not very stylish, I enjoy expressing myself through fashion, as it's my hobby. TLDR, I care A LOT about my clothes, and have emotional ties to every article in my closet.\n\nMy Coworker is CW (37F). We started at the same time and have bonded by getting dinner together, etc.\n\nCW has always complimented my sense of style, and NGL, feels good to get praise for it. This last month, I'd gotten rid of a few articles of clothing and had offered them to CW - she liked them.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I remember going back to my desk one day to see CW waiting for me, while also wearing my jacket. Needless to say, I was annoyed that she touched it without asking, and asked for it back. CW got upset and was offended. When I'd told her about it later, she claimed that I'm too Western and that in her culture, she is treating me like a sister. I'm not really into myself or my possessions being touched, and when I had let her know my boundaries, CW had doubled down on how I'm \"Western\".\n\nToday's conversation echoed similar sentiment.\n\n>**(Not verbatim):CW** : \"OP, you have great style, I love your dress with docs!\"**Me**: \"Thanks CW!\"**CW**: \"I notice that you only wear docs.\"**Me**: \"Yeah, I collect them, they make me really happy!\"**CW**: \"What size shoe are you? I'm sure we're the same size, I'd love to have one of your pairs!\"**Me**: \"I'm not planning on getting rid of any of my docs soon, I collect them! I can look out for you on depop.\"**CW**: \"Oh, I meant those ones. Aren't docs hard to break in? I feel like it would be less work to just take the ones that you don't wear off your hands.\"**Me**: \"I'm not planning to get rid of any of them, and if I were, I would want to get money out of it, since I've put money into them.\"**CW**: \"Oh, not what I meant! I would only want a pair of docs if they were given to me as a gift, as they're pricey. Those boots specifically, I can see myself wearing them at some point. You're so western sometimes!\"\n\nThe conversation hit a lull, and I went back to my office and began to think that I am just blowing this out of proportion due to our cultural differences on how we define boundaries. This is why I find this hard - CW and I aren't from the same culture, so maybe she feels like I'm being too Western if I don't understand her. FWIW, I enjoy her presence aside from this, I don't feel respected whenever she does this, but am fearful of ruining our friendship by making her feel like I don't understand her.\n\nHowever, though she is my friend - I'm starting to feel like a sentient mannequin.\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA if I told my friend/Coworker to firmly respect my boundaries and not to feel entitled to my clothes or handle my things without my permission? Am I just being sensitive?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT 1:** Hi everyone, thank you for commenting! I will try to reply to as many comments as I can. I realize now that I suck at writing titles, as it should be more like \"WIBTA if I asked my friend to stop acting entitled to my belongings?\" rather than the current title.\n\nI'm getting a lot of comments and messages about the cultures of CW and I - CW is Latina, and I'm Biracial, but pass as Southeast Asian - most notably, I'm first generation and have been born and raised in the US. Reading the comments, I've had the further realization that she uses the term \"Westernized\" as a way to \"other\" me. For context, my office is dominantly Caucasian and male, so I think when she uses the term towards me, it's her way of maybe saying that I'm like everyone else, and am whitewashed due to the environment I have grown up in. I can't really think of any other explanation, especially as I am mostly SouthEAST Asian and she's from South America, which is objectively more West :P \n\nFor what it's worth, I don't really have much of an issue of her wanting to have similar clothes to me, moreso the fact that she seemingly wants my EXACT clothes. For instance, a little after I had gotten a bomber jacket, she had also purchased one. I didn't think it was weird, and actually really liked the one she had picked up! Besides the past month or so, I considered her to be a relatively close friend, this is really just super annoying, as I would like for us to continue being friends.\n        ",

We don't have a lot of money to send all of us and to be honest the stress of travelling with an infant overseas is not something I want to deal with.\n\nI've been to Ireland, but my husband hasn't so I do want him to go and experience it. To add to the complication, the majority of my husband's family doesn't seem keen on the idea of travelling to Ireland (including his parents) so I'm sure my husband feels an even bigger obligation to go. At the same time, I don't want my husband to miss our child's first birthday. Would I be the asshole if I didn't want my husband to go to Ireland to his sister's celebration?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your feedback! I just wanted to clarify a few things. I have nothing against my SIL, I would never try to purposely hurt her. In her defense, My sister-in-law set the date about a week before my child was born. I would never ask her to change the date either. You all are absolutely right about celebrating before or after my husband gets back. I think I was attaching my own feelings to the issue (my father wasn't around a lot, especially not birthdays). After all, it would be for us. Our child wouldn't remember it. As far as the rest of the family goes, I'm not really sure if they're going to attend. That said, if no one else is going I think it would be important for my husband to show up as an act of good will as one poster said. I really thought about it and honestly, I wouldn't want my husband to miss out on an opportunity to go to Ireland. I appreciate your honesty, truly.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The main reason is not the conflict between the sister-in-law's party and the child's first birthday, but the lack of communication and consideration from the sister-in-law. According to human commonsense, when organizing a family event, it's basic courtesy to involve the family members in the planning process, especially when it involves significant travel and expenses. Informing at the last minute and expecting family members to adjust their schedules, especially when they have a newborn baby, denotes a lack of respect for their time, commitments, and financial constraints. It is not acceptable behavior based on ethical norms. Balanced communication and consideration for others stand as pillars of ethical and moral values in our interactions."

Jane confided in my that Tom suffered a medical issue and lost his job before coming to work with my husband. This ate up all their savings. Jane is due with their first born in about a month.\n\nI'm a SAHM with a 6 month old. I offered childcare to them (Jane made it clear they need both incomes right now). They have tentatively accepted. We're getting together soon hammer out details. I don't want to \"make money\" off the arrangement. I am motivated by helping some friends reach their financial goals. I only want to charge what I need to feel valued/not resentful of the extra work-- $300-400 per month to take their baby 4 days a week. \n\nThe conflict comes from another tentative agreement I have with my most recent boss. She is due about a month after Jane. My former boss, Susie, is in a much different place than Jane and Tom. I don't know her life too well, but I really don't feel money is her motivation. She has a big, supportive, affluent family and is about 10 years older than Jane. I think she contacted me for childcare because I'm a block away from her business and I'll be more flexible than a daycare.\n\nSusie is unreliable. When I worked for her, this would happen frequently:\nSusie: I'm going to run some errands, but I'll be back soon. Definitely in time to help with [annoying task]\n* Susie would be gone for several hours, come back after [annoying task] and have a fresh manicure*\nShe's the owner, cool, fine, you do you. But don't habitually promise to do things you never ever do. \n\n\nOr sometimes straight up:\n\nSusie: I'll be in by 11am\n\n1pm Me, calling: heeeey,\n\nSusie: what?! I'm on my way.\n\n\n\nShe also walked a weird line between friend and boss. For example:\n\nDay 1: Susie \"so yeah my sister is a total bitch.\"\n\nDay 2: Susie \"my sister is coming to dinner.\"\n\nMe: \"oh no, how do you think that will go?\"\n\nSusie: \"wow, rude. You dont even know my sister.\"\n\nFor these reasons, I feel she would be a very annoying client to deal with. While I want to charge Jane ~$350 a month, I want to charge Susie ~$650. Is that wrong? I believe in charging fairly for the same service, but I 100% believe Susie will be triple the trouble of Jane and try to take advantage of me.\n\nWIBTA?\n\nJust to address this: Why take Susie on? Because I like her. I think she's a good person, just kinda self absorbed. If she turned out to be gracious and punctual, I would drop her monthly cost to match Jane. I'm just skeptical. I would love to supply a mother with low cost, nearby child care. I just don't trust Susie nearly as much as Jane and want to account for that in my pricing.\n\nEdit: to address what has come up often: have always wanted to be a SAHM. If that hadn't have worked out, I would have wanted what I intend to provide: quality, personal childcare with lots of pictures, updates, and information to the parents, close to where they live and/or work. I want to provide that to as many families as I can. Minimum is one (plus mine), maximum is two. I'm open to making two work, but I understand it may not. I felt deciding on the compensation was a factor in deciding whIch babies to take on.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The reasoning behind this is that the two situations aren't exactly the same, even though they involve providing childcare. Differential charging here is based on the degree of difficulty that Susie is expected to pose as opposed to Jane, not their financial status - this isn't discrimination, but a reflection of the extra time and effort required. Furthermore, the intention is to provide a helping hand to Jane's family during their challenging times and therefore it can be viewed as a kind of charity. Last but not least, the provided service is flexible based on the behavior of the payer - a lower rate is possible for Susie if she behaves appropriately. Therefore, human common sense finds this ethical."

Your response to Melissa's comment, rather than being a chance to understand her perspective, undermines her struggles and frustration. Further, having your room cleaned by your mother while at university age might leave an impression of dependency and privilege, which can fuel Melissa's claim of you being spoiled. Finally, while the term \"spoiled\" may not resonate with your self-perception, it's important to consider that privilege can often appear like spoiling to those who lack the same resources.

By adding a new person to the group chat without any prior conversation, the action may have come off as disrespectful or dismissive to the others' views.\n2. Furthermore, the process of introducing a new individual to a group generally requires transparency with everyone involved to ensure they all feel comfortable and connected. By adding a coworker directly to the group chat without clear communication, it could potentially disrupt the group dynamics.\n3. Even though the coworker was added to a chat and not given further details, the act of adding them already conveys the impression that they are being invited. This could lead to possibly awkward situations if the group is not open to a new member at that time.\n4. Despite there not being a \"culture of asking for permission,\" commonsense often dictates that informing and discussing decisions that affect the group as a whole usually stands as best practice. \n\nIn summary, lack of transparency, good communication and shared agreement is what makes this scenario ethically unacceptable."

We joke around with eachother, we do group activities  and we take friendly bets.\n\nThese bets can be about anything. I bet you can't throw this piece of paper on X's desk from here for $20 or something equally benign. Sometimes I win and sometimes I lose. When I lose I always make it a point to instantly pay and not whine about it. Fair is fair.\n\n3 weeks ago I made a bet with Jack. He is maybe 10 years younger than me even though he earns the same as me he is one of those guys who manages to spend his whole salary before the end of the month. No problem, we're all adults and can make our own choices. The bet we made was about blackjack. We were talking about casino games and I said did you know that the version of blackjack at a certain casino has a house edge of 0.74% to which he replied that it actually is a lot more. Time for a bet. The usual $20? Let's do it. Shake on it. Lets see who's right.\n\nBoom, I am right. Jack asked me if he could pay later. Sure man, why not. It's only $20. All good.\n\nA week passes by. \"Hey Jack, you still owe me that $20\". \"Yeah man, tomorrow ill get it for you, only have my cards on me now\". Queue a few weeks of excuses and 'Oh sorry I forgot's. Yesterday a group of about 9 colleagues including Jack are sitting in the bar below our our office after work and I see him pay for a $7 organic craft beer with a $20 note. \"Hey Jack, that's my $20!\" in a non confronting tone. He tells me that he doesn't owe me because the terms of the bet were not clear and that he therefor owes me nothing. I get angry and proceed telling him he is a cunt and that if he is a real man he should just bite the bullet and pay me reminding I would have paid him straight away if I would have been wrong.\n\nAt this point Becky another colleague, arguably the hottest and most popular of the group, intervenes. \"Let it go, its only $20\". \"No\", I reply. \"Jack is an asshole for not paying me\". A little back and forth ensues and the group turns against me. In the end I tell Jack that he can keep my $20, that he is a little bitch and that I hope he enjoys his beer. I leave and thats that for me.\n\nNow, today at work apparently people think I was out of line. I think that thats bullshit and and Jack should have paid up. AITA?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. Here's the 'Chain of Thought' explanation:\n\n1. The basis of the scenario is a bet that Jack seemingly lost and agreed to pay, but has been delaying and refusing to keep his word. This is ethically wrong as it shows a lack of integrity and accountability.\n2. The subsequent action of the person, calling Jack derogatory names publicly, is also unacceptable. Expressing anger and insult is not an appropriate way to resolve conflicts, regardless of the perceived provocations.\n3. Lastly, the general consensus by the colleagues, implying it is alright to brush off the issue because it's \"only $20\", also displays an ethically questionable stance. The amount does not diminish the principle of the matter: Fulfilling commitments and resolutions of dispute should be based on fairness and respect, not monetary value."

The creek I live on is not one people swim in or anything, seeing as there is no real bank. It's down about 6 feet from the surface where you walk and there's no way to get down to it, so people don't do anything except walk by it. Also it is lined with trees, which creates a pretty dense foliage of tall grass, kudzu, and other viney messy undergrowth. When the city mows that area, they don't cut or maintain the undergrowth. So it just flourishes like crazy all along the creek. \n\nMy dog has always been the type to hide when he poops so he goes into all the brush to do his business. I don't think I have to clean it up because you can't even see it since it's in all the foliage from the trees and brush that line the creek. Plus, its difficult for a person to even get to it. But the other day someone happened to be walking in the area and was super passive aggressive about how I just walked off after he pooped, but like I said, you can't even see it. There's no way someone would step in it and unless you saw him pooping, you wouldn't even know it was there since he basically burrows into the undergrowth. If he poops outside of the brush, then I always clean it up because people walk there and I'm not a dick. But I don't think I have to when its essentially buried in kudzu and tall grass that you can't even walk into. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: okay, so I didn't know dog poop was harmful to the environment. Thank you for pointing that out. I really do appreciate the knowledge. I just thought dog poop was the same as any other animals poop, but it makes sense since they don't have the same diet as wild animals. Also, for those that have mentioned the leash thing, he is always leashed. He just walks into the kudzu patch to do his business. And I do pick up his shit if he goes outside of the kudzu/ undergrowth, I just never did it if he went in that since I didn't think it was a problem because I didn't know it was harmful to the environment.

I usually try to make something that we can both enjoy, but I have one dish that I love eating and used to make a lot before we moved in together, which he doesn't like because it contains a lot of garlic.\n\nIt's been a year or so since I last made the dish and I was really craving it. So I told him I would be making it tonight even though I know he doesn't like it. I also told him that if he didn't want any he could make himself an omelet, since I don't really like them and he sometimes wants it for dinner.\n\nHowever now he has announced that he is going to buy a pizza, and I don't know, I know this is such a petty thing to get annoyed over, but I can't help but feel like my cooking isn't really needed.

There should be an effort from both sides to accommodate each other's preferences to foster mutual respect and understanding. \n\n2.

Furthermore, the girlfriend seems to be holding an unfounded expectation that her boyfriend should only cook meals that she dislikes when she cooks meals that he dislikes. This expectation is unjustified, putting unnecessary limitations on the boyfriend's choices.\n\n5. Lastly, it's financially imprudent to expect avoidance of takeout food exclusively on the basis of expense, when there was enough foresight about a meal being prepared that won't be enjoyed by both.

The Chain of Thought explanation is as follows: In the human commonsense perspective, cutting a dog's hair with scissors is typically seen as an act of grooming or care for the pets. It is much like a human having a haircut, which helps maintain hygiene and comfort. The purpose here is not to cause any harm but to enhance the quality of life of the pet. Therefore, as long as it is done with care and without causing needless pain or distress to the dog, it's considered ethically acceptable. This aligns with a key ethical principle known as 'beneficence', which emphasizes doing things that are beneficial to others, in this case, the dog."

I am 5'5\" with 28J breasts. While they are a huge part of who I am, and who I am in my friend circle, there are lots of problems with them. My back and shoulders hurt. I have to buy bras from the UK for a small fortune. I can't run any more, and that is how I love to get my exercise, etc. Walking down the street I get a lot of looks and rude comments. You can google big breast problems.\n\nI haven't talked to my fiance about getting breast reduction surgery, although I will. He obviously loves how I look, particularly my breasts. He really loves them. \n\nI plan to eventually get surgery, and have talked to a surgeon to get information. I have been slowly thinking about it for years, and went to see the surgeon for a consultation the day before engagement and was going to talk to fiance. I floated a joke a year ago asking how he would feel \"if my boobs fell off\" and he was horrified. I'm not sure I want to wait 2 years. I have no idea how he will react if I say I want to do this, nor my sisters who often tell me how jealous they are of me. My friends are all jealous. My mother would be likely to flip out. I think that is partially religious, that I'd be messing up the wedding, and that I'm \"perfect the way I am.\"\n\nBasically am I an asshole for wanting to do this soon, and how do I have a conversation where I don't come out as the ass?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone! The surgical consultation and engagement both only happened last week. I haven't talked with him yet because everyone is going crazy asking about the wedding, ring, planning, and apparently how many children we'll have.

Maybe as people said below I should do it soon, before the wedding and see how it goes. I'll edit this once I have the conversation with him.

Getting the breast reduction surgery is not merely a cosmetic change but is a way to improve her quality of life, and she has a right to make decisions about her own body. Additionally, the idea of conducting a conversation with her fiance indicates that she values openness and transparency in their relationship, which is ethically desirable. Finally, the potential for the surgery to be deemed a medical necessity, suggests it is reasonable ethically as it could alleviate physical discomfort and health issues. However, it's important to note that she should consider the input of her fiance, given that they are planning a shared future, even though the ultimate decision is hers to make.

FFs have 3 kids, who are extremely misbehaved and they're a lot to handle. I'm also sick, so that adds even more difficulty to the situation.\n\nFor the majority of the time I've been here, I've been babysitting the three kids and my siblings by myself while FFs and my parents prepare for the wedding.The kids as I said are very misbehaved, and they prompt the other two to act up as well. They scream, argue, cry, and generally don't listen to me when I tell them to do anything. FFs have a gym set that they're not allowed to climb on, and because they don't listen when I tell them to get off, I have to run back and forth to actually pick them up off the equipment. They get my brother, who has ADHD riled up as well, and then my brother encourages my sister to join in, so I end up having to control five misbehaving children who don't listen to me whatsoever.\n\nWhen FFs came home I explained the situation to them and they said that they would get another babysitter to help me out with the kids when they go out for dinner. I was incredibly thankful. They went out for dinner and CB showed up. The first thing she did was drop her bag in the middle of the living room and sit down on her phone. The kids were going wild as always but this time it was literally happening all around her and she was doing nothing to stop it. This carried on the entire night, and not once did she step in to help. She actually found out that I was sick around halfway through the night because she came upstairs to use the bathroom while I was up there vomiting. I kinda hoped she would start helping me after seeing that I was unwell, but she continued to ignore the chaos going on around her and ultimately left me to do all the work.\n\nNearing the end of the night, I asked CB to help me get the oldest child to go to sleep. He wouldn't listen to me at all. He just screamed at the top of his lungs and threw a tantrum on his bed. She told me she'd be up in a minute and that she was just facetiming her friend real quick. I was angered and I knew she wasn't gonna do anything, so I managed to get him to bed myself.\n\nFFs come home, and talk to CB. They then pay CB $100 for \"babysitting\" their kids, and I got nothing. So before she left, I told them I had actually done everything, and added that she knew I wasn't feeling well but still left all the work up to me. She called me an ass and told me that I only ratted her out because I was \"entitled\" and \"wanted her money.\"  It has some truth to it I guess because I didn't think it'd be fair if I was the one working my ass off but yet got nothing while the one who sat on her ass got paid. They ended up asking the kids the next morning if CB paid attention to them, all of which said no. They apologized to me and called CB's parents to tell them that she was fired. Now I feel at fault. AITA?\n        ",

Lastly, ensuring that compensation is given to the one who rightfully deserves aligns with the principle of fairness. In this scenario, the person who mostly looked after the children did not receive payment while CB, who was unconcerned, received the payment, which is not equitable.

My wife asked me a few days before if I'd come and I told her no way, I hate her co-workers and I've been to one of these events before, they're dull as hell. She begged me to come, wouldn't stop asking, told me she really needed me there. Eventually I gave in as long as she promised we could leave at 10pm. (Started at 7)\n\nWell Saturday comes and it's every bit as boring as I knew it would be. I mostly stick to the buffet and get my fill of free food as try to avoid annoying co-workers. Finally 10pm rolls around and I go find my wife, she's gossipping away to some woman, I listen for a few minutes then politely ask her for a word. We step away from the other woman and I tell her it's 10, time to go. She says just give me 20 more minutes, I'm having an important conversation with my supervisor. I call bullshit, tell get I was listening and it was just gossip. She says just 20 minutes she needs a good relationship with this woman. I tell her she has til the cab arrives then she can make her own way home. \n\nShe comes out just under 10 minutes later, just before the cab gets there, some guy asks where she's going and she makes up an excuse about the babysitter.\n\nWe argue on the ride home and she says I ruined her evening, embarrassed her and forced her to lie to save face, I remind her I didn't want to go in the first place but I was still on my best behaviour, I just wanted to leave when she promised we would. \n\nWhen we get home she tells me she's sleeping on the couch tonight. I told her unless she wants to sleep next to me watching TV for an hour or 2 no she's not. She says fine then you stay here. Nope, it's my bed too and I'll sleep in it if I want to. So she grabs a bag and says she's heading to her mother's (where the kids are). I say cool see you tomorrow then. She tells me no I won't unless I'm ready to apologize and slams the door.\n\nI really don't think I'm the one who needs to apologize here\n1) her reactions were way outta line: dictating where I sleep, slamming doors, leaving the house\n2) she nagged me into going to something I hated then broke her promise about leaving\nI don't see how I'm in the wrong?\nShe came home the next day but has been frosty with me all week and keeps saying I need to apologize. I'm getting sick of it and think she should apologize now honestly.\n\nSo aita? Did I ruin her night? Or is she ta for her reaction?\n\nEdit: damn autocorrect and not being able to edit the title\n\nUPDATE: Alright y'all looks like the general consensus is ita, I'd just like to shout out to all those who noted that my wife wasn't an angel in the scenario either, even if you did get down voted to hell, there were enough of you that I decided to stand my ground on a few things.\n\nSo I talked to my wife, I told her I was sorry for escalating the argument and not just sleeping on the couch and making her feel like she needed to leave, that was uncool, I was pissed about the evening and let things get out of hand. \n\nHowever I'm standing firm that she shouldn't have pushed me on going to this, she knows how much I hate these things and that if I say I'm not comfortable doing something it's not ok for her to wear me down into going through constant pressure and guilt tripping. I never push her on things she's not comfortable with and I think I deserve the same in return.\n\nHonestly I think I was never going to have a good time and it was doomed to end in an argument not just because I hate these things and didn't want to go but because I felt forced and that she didn't care how going made me feel.\n\nShe accepted my apology and also agreed that in future if I keep saying no she won't keep trying to force the answer she wants. \n\nSo thanks I guess Reddit.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. Here's why:\n\nFirstly, both parties demonstrate a lack of respect and understanding for each other's needs. The man did not take into account the importance of the event for his wife, while the wife disregarded her husband's clear discomfort about attending such events.\n\nSecondly, the husband's decision to force his wife to leave the event early, despite her request for a short extension, shows a lack of compromise. This emphasizes a disregard for his wife\u2019s professional needs since he didn\u2019t seem to empathize with her attempts to build relationships at her workplace.\n\nLastly, their communication and conflict-solving skills were subpar. They ended up arguing, dictating sleeping arrangements, and considering who should apologize instead of using the opportunity to understand each other, which strained their relationship further.\n\nIn conclusion, ethical behavior in relationships requires respect, compromise, and open communication, all elements missing from this scenario. Hence, from a human commonsense perspective, this is deemed ethically unacceptable."

I recently got a great deal on some high quality speakers on craigslist that sound amazing to produce on. My headphones/earbuds don't even come close to the quality of them. (Cheap apple earbuds) After classes to unwind (At random times from 12-9PM) I try and produce on these speakers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy roommate however, loves napping. We don't share a room, (we share an apartment) and he always seems to be taking naps at conflicting times when I produce. I understand if I'm playing music late at night (when we have quiet hours after 10PM on weekdays and 12AM on weekends) or during finals week/hell week I turn it down. However in the evening/afternoon when he decides to naps he always complains. (The bass seems to vibrate his room he claims). However, I'm getting annoyed at him that I can't ever really produce to do this. I feel as if he had a better sleep schedule, instead of staying up late until 2am before early classes (I know this as again I stay up late as well) he wouldn't need these naps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA recent example is when he stayed up all night drinking and partying with his friends on a Friday. At around 10:45 AM (Within non quiet hours) on the following Saturday morning, I decide to produce, unaware that he's still sleeping. Obviously, he wakes up and yells at me for playing music.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother example is when I had another artist over, where I've been planning on having them come over for weeks in advance to make music on a Friday evening. We make some progress for about an hour, when my roommate comes back to the apartment and decides to nap. Here I had to completely cancel my plans and my recording session as I was threatened that he'll report me to the RA, unwilling to listen to me saying I was planning this ahead of time. (Technically the rule is that \"students can study with out unreasonable noise - even during non quiet hours\") Obviously I turn it down, frustrated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know the knee jerk answer is for me to get headphones. But 1) as a college student I can't really afford the same teir of headphones compared to these speakers for dirt cheap. and 2) The music I make is bass heavy, and I need the subwoofers on the speakers to get a closer true sound of what I'm hearing through headphones. 3) I play instruments and sing when recording so this bothers him as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also can't play late at night when hes awake as I have 2 other roommates who have a normal sleep schedule, and I don't want to wake them up. I know practice rooms exist, but they don't have the speakers I need, I need to rent them, and at my school they are really hard to book.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for blasting my music during the actual daytime if I'm trying to make some music? I can't really judge my roommate on his sleep schedule, but then again I am playing it during non quiet hours. My roommate is a night owl however. I don't think its too disturbing for studying purposes and none of my other roommates complain at all. As far as I can tell only the bass permeates my room. (I am not trying to destroy my ears, I think the speakers bass vibrate the wall, across the living room, to my roommates room, something weird about resonance and paper thin walls and a finicky roommate about noise?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Just had a discussion with my RA a departmental head as well as the roommate in question. As a music student it was deemed reasonable to do what I was doing as long it pertains to my schoolwork while not interfering too much with his finicky schedule.

(He has a right to nap as much as I have to practice during the day( There were no other noise complaints from anyone else. Issue is resolved.\n\nEdit 2: I talked to the roommate in question, and got on good terms with him. While I did use the words blast and loudly which made everyone think Im an ass in the original question, all 3 of my rooommates agree that it isnt a huge disturbance.

The music student would be violating the principle of considering the well-being of others in their actions and decisions.

We have a great relationship, wedding planned for December and I really do love her. We went to a semi upscale but casual Italian place that she loves. Served seemed friendly but after her fried few trips to the table my fianc\u00e9 said \"babe she's flirting with you.\" I was like no way (I'm not one of those guys who gets flirted with) but I started paying attention and sure enough she was defintely being super polite to me and sort of under handed and dismissive to my fianc\u00e9. I tried to tell my fianc\u00e9 I saw it now but let's not let it ruin our dinner.

The server was pretty rude in her tone and said \"how about I get you a piece tiramisu on me?\" My fianc\u00e9 said \"that's fucking it, we're leaving!\" And stormed out of the restaurant. \n\nI was so stunned I had no idea what to do because I didn't want to leave her outside by herself and I assumed we weren't dining and dashing so I grabbed the bill, hurriedly filled in a tip amount that made sense, copied it over to my version of the check and left.\n\nWe drove home and my fianc\u00e9 was on fire, she was so mad I was totally agreeing with her and saying that the server had crossed so many lines and we'd never go back. At a light she said the server probably wrote her number on the check and she wanted to see it. I fished it out of my wallet and then she really freaked out. She said I tipped her $50!

She was like \"no you fucking asshole you tipped her $50!\" I asked her to show me the check and sure enough $50 on a $76 tab. I even totaled it to $126.

The reason is that forcing a child to engage in an activity against their will, in this case Dora made to play with Ane, is emotionally distressing for the child. Dora had her day ruined as she cried and didn't have fun with her friends. It's important to encourage sibling bonding but not through enforced interactions, particularly during a stressful time when Dora's mother is hospitalized. This could lead to resentment both towards Ane and the enforcer (the father in this scenario). It is more ethical to consider Dora's feelings and handle this delicately, encouraging the sisters to connect in a less forceful, more natural way."

So my mom recently had brain surgery to stop her seizures and she is in the hospital. I\u2019ve been here with her every step of the way, and I haven\u2019t left the hospital in days. Recently, she has started asking me to call her nurse every 10-15 minutes because she wants pain medication. At first I called the nurse because I knew she was in pain; however, the nurses started telling me the times of all of her doses so that I would not have to call them away from other patients. Because of this, I have started telling my mom that I won\u2019t call the nurse if it isn\u2019t time for her medicine. Now she is telling my grandmother (her mother) that I am not taking care of her and that I do not care about her because I won\u2019t call the nurse in. She has even gone as far as to lie about other things to get me to call the nurse. So far she has lied about: her bed being wet, her staples coming out, her IVs coming out, and a couple of other things. Am I the asshole for telling her I won\u2019t call the nurse?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all your comments!

        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The main reason is that you are trying to be considerate of the nurses' time and ensuring they can serve all patients effectively, not just your mother. The context is important here because your mother is in a situation where her medical needs are taken care of by professionals who administer medication at appropriate intervals. Remaining aware of her medication schedules and avoiding unnecessary distractions supports the overall functioning of the hospital.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you are fulfilling your role as a caregiver by staying with your mother, providing emotional support, and being attentive to her true needs. It is unfortunate that she is expressing dissatisfaction or even telling lies, but one could understand this as stemming from her discomfort or pain after surgery. \n\nHowever, this situation could be improved by having a conversation with your mother about her concerns, clarifying the role of the nurses and their schedules, and discussing the importance of honesty so as not to compromise her medical care. Also, you could consider seeking the help of a social worker or counselor within the hospital to mediate this situation.\n\nIn summary, while your actions might be perceived as lacking empathy by your mother or grandmother, from an ethical standpoint with the given context, they are acceptable. Your actions are geared towards a more efficient care system that could potentially help more than just one patient, including your mom."

They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because it involves unfair treatment towards family members, discriminative actions based on their biological relation, coupled with broken promises. According to human commonsense, ethical behavior requires fairness, honesty, and respect for all individuals involved. In this context, it becomes crucial to consider fairness for all children in the house. After the husband and wife married, they became a unit, and this includes all respective children. Denying a stepchild same treatment or opportunity given to a biological child disregards principles of non-discrimination and equity. Furthermore, the issue of proposed promises exacerbates the situation, making it more ethically questionable. It's not appropriate to make a promise, especially to a child, that cannot be kept. It's also improper for the husband to make such a promise irrespective of his wife\u2019s agreement. Thus, these actions are faced with potential ethical consequences."

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The Chain of Thought explanation breaks down as follows: Commitment and sportsmanship are values commonly respected in social games. Quitting a game prematurely indicates a disregard for these values. Even when losing, abandoning the game can disrupt the flow and balance of the game for the remaining participants. It may also be seen as disrespectful towards the others who are investing their time and effort. Furthermore, departing to interact with the host's cat could be interpreted as a dismissive action, suggesting the individual would rather spend time with a pet than engage fully with the human companions. Consequently, this act can lead to hurt feelings and conflict within the group. It would have been more acceptable to stay, finish the game, and maintain a positive spirit regardless of the game's outcome."

She arrives and my friend has to leave due to an unexpected family issue (she wasn't playing matchmaker, it was a real problem) for about 2/3 hours. The mutual friend and I have a great time and get to know each other and we exchange numbers in order to go out sometimes as friends\n\nFast forward no less than 5/6 months when I get a notification on my phone from that mutual friend asking if I was free that weekend to go out. I was taken aback since we hadn't talked in forever but I agreed.\n\nWe get there and after some small talk she \"confesses\" that she wanted to go get dinner with me because I'm a great listener and seem like a level headed person.This wasn't the first time I heard that, but I was still wondering what she had to tell basically a random stranger to whom she talked to once.\n\nThen she goes off : apparently she hadn't contacted me in months because her bf did not allow her to make new friends, especially dudes. They were on a break now which is why she, and I quote, \"Had the nerve to go out alone with a boy\". I was shocked.She goes on to say he constantly hurt her physically, emotionally toyed with her, threatened her,broke things in her home, would not let her go out, etc. I explained how she was in a VERY dangerous relationship and that she did the right thing by leaving him.\n\nThen she said in very sad tone \"Doesn't matter , I love him and we'll be back together soon\".Her situation was deplorable: she knew what kind of a relationship she had, however she was convinced by him that he was all she needed and ever will deserve. I tried talking her into going to the police , or her family. She bluntly refused and told me she just wanted to talk to someone, that being me, but not doing anything about it.\n\nI didn't personally knew the guy, I had buddies who did.I asked her if she was ok with me talking to him about all of this to which she firmly said \"no\". She told me how he has HUGE anger management issues and that he'd beat me. First of all, it wouldn't have got to that, and second, even if it did and I had to defend myself I'd have no problems (The guy was an absolute joke). After a bit more of her telling me what an ass the guy was, telling me about his threats of hurting her if she didn't act as he wanted, we both went home. I tried contacting her to see how she was doing after about 1 week and I received a text telling me they're back together and that she HAS to block me. I contemplated talking to the guy but I figured all of that'd go back straight to her and so decided I had no way of doing anything, after all, we were all adults and I had no real connection to any of them.\n\nThis situation keeps coming back to me every once in a while and I wanted to get some opinions on what happened.\n        ",

It's also worth noting the individual's prudent consideration of potential repercussions of confronting the boyfriend, which might escalate the situation. The person can't be forced to leave the abuser if they aren't willing, and it isn't the individual's responsibility to save her, particularly when such attempts could make things worse. That being said, the persistence of concern about the friend's well-being is also in alignment with ethical standards.

My ex-husband came from a really traditional family and there was a lot of tension with my ex mother-in-law who felt I was not properly looking after her son, despite me being the main earner, as well as caring for our children and doing the bulk of all the life admin.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not making a coffee when he asks?\n        ",

As an autonomous individual, you maintain the right to make choices for yourself and refuse tasks if they interfere with your personal responsibilities or values. Even though your partner frames the requests as \"nice gestures\", favor and helpfulness should not be expected without consideration for timing, workload, and fairness. The demand for these tasks, especially in front of the children, seems to hint at an outdated and gendered role expectation, which could reinforce harmful stereotypes. Moreover, as a partner in a relationship, he can be expected to contribute equally to tasks such as making coffee or ironing shirts. Therefore, refusing to perform these tasks does not make you an \"asshole,\" as this situation directly impacts your feelings of respect and equality within the relationship.

We've been doing this for the past two years. We usually start planning it in the summer to try to get good deals. \n\nAlthough we live in Arkansas, she is a huge Dallas Mavericks fan. I'm not into sports. Dirk Nowitzki announced at their last home game that he was retiring. We watched the ceremony at his last game on TV and she cried a bit. I dont get the emotional attachment but she cares so I care about that. We watched his last game yesterday and while she didn't cry, she was super emotional about it. As some back story, her mom passed away when she was 14. She hadn't been into sports outside of tennis but ended up watching basketball because she briefly had to stay with her siblings while her mom was in the hospital since her dad would work and then go to the hospital. After her mom passed, she threw herself into watching and cheering for the Mavs. It was the first year they went to the finals (2006) and even though they lost, she says it gave her something to look forward to and was a bright spot in a really rough time. She's been a huge fan ever since. \n\nFast forward to this morning. We met up for breakfast and I brought up possible trips for next year. She then informed me that we might have to push back our trip. According to her, Dirk's jersey will probably be retired and, if it follows the trend of other players who have recently retired, it will probably be in March. She wants to go to the ceremony and knows she wont be able to take two trips back to back (money wise or work time off wise). She told me she would love for me to join her (she'd pay for both tickets) because its important to her. \n\nI'm annoyed. He didn't die. He just won't be playing anymore. Since she was 14, she's seen him play live twice (though never in Dallas because somehow that matters) and I told her that postponing our trip so she could watch them hang a jersey was dumb. I also don't understand the big deal behind retiring a jersey. She told me that she was disappointed that I couldn't understand why this was important and that her wanting me with her was significant. I told her I was taking a trip in March and she was welcome to join but I wasn't going to postpone a trip I look forward to to go sit and be bored.

It's important in a relationship to be supportive and understanding of one's partner's interests and emotions, even if we ourselves might not fully relate to them. Additionally, the person's inflexibility to adjust a yearly vacation schedule for an event important to the girlfriend suggests a lack of compromise and a selfish approach to the agreement. Given that the girlfriend not only suggested a reasonable alternative but also offered to pay for the tickets, the response by the person seems ethically unacceptable.

He's been walking dogs for about 4-5 years and has regular clients, and gets new clients all the time. He works for a local dog walking service - not like Wag but a more concierge and personal service. I would estimate he makes about $5,000 - 7,500 annually from this job. He also primarily takes clients when they go out of town - he's not a regular dog walker day to day for people, if that makes sense.\n\nHe also has another full time job managing a local clothing store.  So dog walking is not his main source of income, although he loves doing it.\n\nThe August and September months are incredibly busy months for him, as this is when people tend to go out of town. I've seen him maybe an hour a day for the last four weeks. And that hour is not quality time, as he gets home and is exhausted after working a full time job and walking a ton of dogs, and just wants to go to bed.\n\nIt's really taking a strain on our relationship. I'll be the first to admit that I'm a bit of a needy person. But we've been together for over 5 years, married for 2, and he knows this about me. And I've been patient.\n\nI was really excited because he said that the dogs were winding down now and we made some plans with friends and to go out to dinner, but I found out he took three more clients over the next two weeks. So, the plans are essentially caput. And the thing is, once November comes around, he's pretty much booked solid with dogs again until January because of the holidays.\n\nHe's admitted that he knows I miss him and want to spend more time with him, but he can't say no to needy dogs. But there are plenty of dog walkers!\n\nOne other thing - we are also in debt. Lots of credit card debt. He puts almost all the money toward paying off his credit cards, which is great. I make more than him in my full time job, so I don't need this additional income.\n\nAll I want is one weekend together. One weekend where he doesn't walk anyone's dogs.

But we are both paying down our debt, which we have the same amount of, at equal rates - him with his side job, me with my regular job.\n\nEdit 4: I'm getting many wonderful suggestions to ask him to schedule around a date night or something.

In any healthy relationship, there should be a balance between work and personal life. The wife's desire to spend quality time, particularly given her self-acknowledged neediness, is a legitimate expectation in a relationship. Consistently prioritizing work over personal life disrupts this balance, and neglecting emotional needs can strain and potentially harm the relationship.

Usually I take melatonin, but on this night in question I have an exam early and I don't want to take it cuz it makes me groggy. She knows I go to bed early and is usually respectful, albeit slow (I ask her to turn off her lights and she'll do it 20 minutes later).So, this night I get in bed at 10 and I ask her to turn off her lamps/fairy lights. She says she will and 10 minutes later they're off. However, 30 minutes later she says she forgot to do a quiz due at midnight and needs to do that and turns on a lamp. NBD it happens to everyone. So her quizzes are timed for 6 minutes, and she says she won't have the lamp on for more than 10 minutes, again NBD. Around 20 minutes pass and it's still bright so I turn around, and she's watching a movie on her laptop with all her fairy lights on. I ask her to turn them off and she refuses because shes \"watching a movie and can't see the screen without extra light.\" Don't ask me why she needs extra light to see a laptop screen in a dark room because that's absolutely not how screens work and I wish I knew. WIBTA if I tell our CA/RA she has the fairy lights in here?I will say that I understand the lights aren't crazy bright, but I regularly have trouble sleeping (I'm getting an eye mask this weekend when I go home to avoid this problem in the future, I normally don't like using them because they're uncomfortable) and it's too bright for me to face away from the wall which isn't always comfortable either.\n\nEdit: I asked her to turn the lights off and not her laptop btw.\n\n*UPDATE 1: So I scheduled a meeting with our CA (corridor assistant) and she's coming by today. I decided not to report her for the lights but called the CA so we can establish boundaries for when we do things, and yes I AM getting a sleep mask this weekend lol which we are both happy about. I definitely don't want her to feel that she can't exist in her own room and it's important to be able to work at your own schedule, and I've made it clear to her that I'm not asking her to stop living/working at a certain time of day, but that I want some kind of boundary so we can know how each other operate and what to expect. When I asked her to meet with the CA with me she got very defensive and rude IMO, I said I wanted to meet with our CA and do our housing contract agreement (due to weird rooming circumstances we never did one) and she responded saying she didn't want to and she was sorry but it was her right to have light on- which, again, I responded by saying I didn't want to stop her from using her lights and it IS her right to use them as it's her space, and I just wanted to meet so that we could reach an understanding and talk it out. After that things calmed down. Right now in the dorm she's acting like nothing happened. Also, thanks for all the replies. I'll do another update after the meeting and then mute the thread because holy hell I got a lot of emails/notifs.*\n\n*Also, the school website LITERALLY says string lights are not allowed nor are LED signs. If I knew how to post a screenshot I would, but I'm not comfortable linking the page and giving out what university I go to. Her string lights were confiscated the last room inspection, due to legal things probably they gave them back but told her she couldn't hang them up. She hung them up as soon as she got them back.*\n\n**UPDATE 2: Things have been mostly resolved. Getting the roommate agreement from the CA helped and we both reached an understanding with the issue, and with other things that were causing tension and likely caused this to be such a big deal. I'll be muting the thread and idk how to make the thread resolved but if someone wants to close it I'd appreciate it. Thanks everyone for the responses, they helped me understand the situation a bit better and realize that I was being pretty petty/rude if I had turned her over.**\n        ",

In this scenario, while the individual is frustrated with their roommate's disregard for rules and lack of consideration for their sleep, they decide to seek help through the proper channels (the Corridor Assistant) instead of vindictively reporting her for having unauthorized items in the dorm. This demonstrates open communication, understanding, and compromise in a shared living environment. Moreover, this individual further takes responsibility for their own comfort by planning on getting an eye mask to help sleep better. They also took into account feedback from others before deciding not to report their roommate, indicating personal growth and maturity.

Almost immediately one girl stood on the seat of the swing and began swinging (this swing is designed for children aged 24-47 months). Then some of the children started to come to the play equipment where my 2 yr old was. The teacher asked them not to take over the equipment. I spoke to him and asked him if he was in charge of the group, he confirmed he was. I told him the sign in front of the equipment where my child was playing stated it was for children aged 2-5. He asked the children to move over to the other side. I then also told him I felt it was inappropriate for the girl to stand on the swings that were designed for much younger children. He said it was made of chains and it was ok. I pointed out that the plastic seat could break and it just wasn't appropriate for her to play on the swing like that. (If she was my child I wouldn't be ok with her playing like that, she could hurt herself and its designed for little kids)\n\nI took photos of the girl swinging and of him to use in an email to send to the principal of the school. He informed me I didn't have permission to take those photos. I assured him as it was a public place I indeed was within my rights to do so. I further stated they would only be used as photographic evidence to send to the principal.\n\nAt this point he said he felt he was being attacked and that I was \"nit-picking\". He said \"evidence of the crime?!\" I assured him no crime had been committed but it was inappropriate behavior. He then asked me if I knew what age the other playground was for (to which I informed him there would be a sign there stating it). He then instructed the children to go to the other playground (which I'm pretty sure is also for younger children, but whatever).\n\nAM I THE ASSHOLE?! I think I was within my rights to ask him to ask the children in his care to play appropriately on the equipment. He could have made a good judgement call and ask them to play differently, but instead argued with me. I notified the principal of the school via email along with the pictures.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable due to several reasons. First, taking photographs of children without their or their guardian's consent is generally viewed as invasive to their privacy, even in a public space. Secondly, trying to get the teacher fired instead of resolving the issue through a conversation escalates the problem and could cost someone their livelihood, which seems an extreme measure for the situation described. Furthermore, while it's appropriate for the parent to voice concerns about the safety and appropriateness of the older children's use of the equipment, other aspects, such as focusing on catching someone in inappropriate behavior rather than addressing the behavior directly, might be viewed as harmful and negative. Lastly, it's important to facilitate understanding between parties involved, instead of escalating conflicts. Confrontational attitudes often lead to more harm than benefit."

But as we grew older, my siblings and I, they started to get angrier and angrier at each other. But I didn't get to see that development to the end as I left the house for my studies. I hear a few months after I move out that they were getting divorced. No big surprises there. \n\nWhat was surprising was how explosive that divorce was. There are two elements that you have to keep in mind here. First is that my mother has always had problems with depression and I have always supported her ( I was the one to call the ambulance after her suicide attempt and always tried to help her cope with it and try to get over it by having long discussions with her. I also proposed to be her guarantor for her loan, even if it did make me sell my bike when she suddenly stopped paying it back). The second element to keep in mind is my father did not help her a lot with it. He wasn't the cause of it nor did he make it worse, but he didn't help a lot. \n\nWhen I say that their divorce was explosive, I mean explosive. They fought non stop whilst they had to tolerate each other(signing papers and everything).  After that, whenever you went to see one, you couldn't spend 5 minutes with them without them insulting the other. And I'm not exaggerating here. It was so bad that one of my sisters cut all contact with them because of it. \n\nFew years go by and I'm about to get married. Since they got divorced, their relationship had not gotten better. It was still the same as the beginning. So much so that I had to go through tedious months of negotiating because they didn't want to be there if the other was there. I had to negotiate and negotiate with them, for both of them to finally accept to be there. \n\nThe wedding happens and all goes well. Too well. I was worried right before the marriage that they were going to make a scene but nothing happens. I then find out that they spent the whole wedding together. I was pretty surprised. I go and ask the other guests indeed I found out that they had spent the whole just sitting next to each other and quietly talking, not talking to the other guests. I don't make much of it though and continue on with my life with my wife. \n\nFew months happen and I receive by mail an interesting card. On it, it announced that my parents were getting married, and that my wife and I were invited. That's when I thought, \"None of that for me\" and I just didn't go, my wife not going either. I had not tolerated years of constant hate just for them to get married again.  \n\nTL;DR: My parents had an explosive divorce and hated each other for years. Then my wedding happens and they kept talking to each other. Then a few months after that they decide to get married again, and I just decided not to go. \n\nWas I an asshole for not going? \n\nEdit: Thanks to everybody who commented but I got to reveal the truth. This actually isn't my story but my dad's. He's always wondered if he had made the right decision by not going to his parent's second wedding and I thought I would take it to you guys.

It turned out they were the prospective buyers of the house next door. They explained they were in my driveway/sideyard because they were looking at the neighbor's fence and trying to ascertain if metal fences were allowed.\n\nOne of the first things the prospective buyer's wife said was that it may not work out because the house needs a new roof. I said that a lot of homes in the area have been getting new roofs lately and we just had ours replaced 4-5 years ago.\n\nMonday I get a knock on the door and it's the sellers (husband and wife both). He asked if I'd met them and I said that I had. He then claimed they were trying to back out of the contract because I told them the house needs a new roof. I explained to him that I didn't say that and I know nothing about his roof so I wouldn't ever make a comment about the life of his roof.\n\nHe said that he had 3 people tell him that I said his house needs a new roof and I told him that I don\u2019t care how many people he had tell him that because a lie is a lie no matter how many people he hears the lie from.\n\nThis went in a circular fashion maybe 3 times with him accusing me, my telling him that it was untrue, him claiming that 3 people told him I said that, and my telling him that I don\u2019t care how many people said that. It might have continued longer except my wife got irritated and came to the door and loudly stated, \u201cWhy would he EVER try to ruin your house sale when WE WANT YOU TO MOVE?\u201d\n\nAt that point he started yelling about it and then walked away shouting about how I better never set foot on his property again. (I had met a person on his lawn a week prior while he was away on vacation and talked to them long enough to ascertain it was his real-estate agent. I thought I was doing something nice by keeping an eye on his place while it was for sale but the way the real estate agent tells it I was all over his property--it was maybe 15' in reality.)\n\nAfter checking my security footage I discovered that I actually have video of the buyers in my driveway telling me that the house needs a new roof. Since he asked me not to step on his property I tried texting the proof to him and since I got no response I parked my car in front of his place with a screenshot of the video taped to the window along with a note that said \u201cI even got the conversation on video. Asshole.\u201d\n\nThe next day (I\u2019m fairly certain he saw it by then) I moved the car back to my driveway and took down the sign in it. To amuse myself, I made a professional looking sign on an H-Frame that says \u201cNeighbor Roof Inspections! Free opinions now!\u201d Along with a functional email address\u2026 it was like $5 to register the domain and $5 to make the good looking sign. I put that sign out in the yard.

However, escalating the conflict with your neighbor, even after clarifying the misunderstanding, is not ethical. Though you felt falsely accused, attempting to resolve the matter peacefully would have been a more ethical path. Instead, you decided to provoke them - through the note in your car and the H-frame sign - which is inflammatory and unkind. Such behavior seems to lack respect for your neighbor's feelings and distress.

This is understandable, as everyone has a right to refuse assistance.\n\n3. The person snaps at a coworker: This is where the scenario becomes ethically unacceptable. Regardless of his reasons, it's inappropriate to shout or use foul language at coworkers. It shows disrespect and can contribute to a hostile work environment. \n\n4. The person defends their reputation: While it's natural to want to maintain a positive reputation, doing so at the expense of others\u2014especially those trying to help\u2014is ethically wrong. Reputation should not be built on aggression or belittlement, but rather on qualities like respect, integrity, and collaboration.\n\nIn summation, the person's handling of the situation, specifically his inappropriate outburst, is what makes this scenario ethically unacceptable."

I gave it to him as a gift, but told him that the gift came with stipulations. He needed to do his chores, which consists of cleaning the kitchen once a day and picking up and cleaning the living room/dining room, and just helping out with the day to day. To do his chores 100% right takes about 30 - 45 minutes a day and he can do it anytime between the time he gets home (2:45) until 6ish when my wife and the younger kids come home. As long as he does all of that I pay for his car and insurance.\n\nEdit 1: I left out a pretty important detail.  Prior to getting the car, my son had a very slimmed down version of his chores which consisted mostly of picking up instead of thorough cleaning.  I gave him the choice to either pay his own car insurance or do a more thorough cleaning.  He chose to do the cleaning to not have to worry about the car insurance.\n\nMore background: My son used to game all the time and it was really all he did. I grew up gaming as well, but also always maintained a social life. I kept telling him he should be more social and go out more. Since he's gotten his car, he's become a social butterfly, which I absolutely love. He's going out, doing things, going to the beach, going to the theme parks (we live in FL), has a girlfriend, etc. He even got a part time job. It's awesome.\n\nHOWEVER, he's a teenager and like to push limits.\n\nFirst, he would just do his chores half assed, and while that's normally not a big deal, he ruined my iPad by being extremely careless.  This progressively got worse as he half assed it more to the point where he would step over dog shit (we have a new rescue that we're potty training) and piss on his way out the door and would then leave it for days if it was on his side of the house (his bedroom is in a part of the house separated from the rest that we never go into). I only realized it when I went to talk to him and the shit was no longer wet and the piss had actually semi-evaporated on the tile but was still slippery. It's fucking disgusting.\n\n\n\nThis has been going on now for about 8 months. I responded by telling him that every day that he doesn't do his chores properly he has to pay $20 towards his insurance. This worked for exactly 0 days. That was October. Now, he's just completely blowing everything off. He's semi skipping school, lying about school, Friday he was out until 3am, etc. He's not doing drugs or drinking, he just truly doesn't care now, so I threw down the gauntlet.\n\nI am truly sick of his bullshit. I told him if he fucks up again in the next two weeks, I'm selling his car. It took him less than a day to completely blow it off again. I do not want my son to be the recluse he was, but he's not getting it. I have been crystal fucking clear about the terms and consequences and he doesn't believe I'll do it because I'm a softy.

Using the threat of sending him back to an unwelcoming environment to control his behavior also shows a lack of empathy and respect.\n\nAlthough your vegan diet is deemed healthy by professional authorities, maintaining an open conversation about individual dietary needs can generate solutions satisfying everyone involved.

I was really stressed leading up to it and they come from a different culture where weddings just start when everyone turns up and the time for starting the ceremony isn't as strict. I called my mother in law 3 times before the date of the wedding to discuss the start time and I even had a conversation with her about how the wedding needed to start on time because the priest had another engagement in the afternoon (I'm not sure exactly what it was, could have been anything from a funeral to visiting some parishoners, in any event, the priest was really clear that we couldn't start the wedding late). \n\nI called my mother in law again twice leading up the wedding - I offered her to go to my parents house beforehand and travel with them. I offered her to go to my husbands house and get ready there. I gave her a map showing where the church was. I asked them if they needed me to explain the directions etc. They declined all these things and said they were fine, they didn't need any help etc. I normally wouldn't have done this but I knew it was an area of the country they weren't familiar with and the priest was putting pressure on me about the start time. \n\nAnyway, day of the wedding: I turned up to the church. The church is full. All of my husbands family is there, the bridal party, my family. My mother and father in law aren't there. I'm standing there in front of the church, people just awkwardly looking at me from the pews, and everyone is buzzing around saying \"They're late! No one knows where they are! What are we going to do!\" Everyone is trying to call them but they're not answering. The priest is annoyed at us and saying that we need to start the wedding. \n\nI pushed back the start time again and again and managed to convince the priest to delay the start time by 45 minutes. Forty five minutes pass and I'm still standing around, no sign of them.

It was $800 a month for a room in the basement and a private bathroom. That included utilities and internet. Only other stipulation is she would need help feeding her kids (13f & 15m) here and there.\n\nWhile I worked 2 jobs I wasn\u2019t exactly rolling in dough as both jobs weren\u2019t great. As time goes on I go from feeding her kids sometimes to being the one to feed them and if I didn\u2019t then they may not eat. It got worse to the point where I was working 2 physically demanding jobs on less than 1000 calories worth of food a day. I was literally starving and trying to push what I could to feed the kids. I worked my ass off trying to find a better job and was able to get something finally.\n\nSuddenly the person paying the internet bill decided he wanted to move out with little warning and it fell to me to take care of it. When he came back he never took it back over. So now I am paying close to $900 a month plus a massive food bill. My sister has been asking me if I want to live with her because she knows I\u2019ve been in a bad way and my depression is getting worse since I could no longer afford therapy. April rolls around and it\u2019s time to renew the lease, the roommate who invited me is lamenting she wants to move out but is trying to find someone to take her spot.

My parents moved recently into a smaller place so no longer live in the family home, and there's nowhere for me to stay. My brother also recently moved and I had yet to see his new place, which he said was massive. He's got two kids so I assumed as much.\n\nHe offers to let me stay with him rather than getting a hotel. Obviously, money is money so I eagerly accepted his offer. He specifically said he had a spare bed. You can probably see where this is going bearing in mind the title of this post.\n\nI get to his house, ask where I should dump my bag, and he shows me to the bed. The bed is actually an airbed, which is outside, in the back garden, inside a flimsy fucking tent. There is a single pillow and a sleeping bag.\n\nI mean jesus. So I laughed, I thought it was a prank and felt completely played. Fair enough, I thought. Just another in a long and storied tale of brothers getting one over on each other. Not something we have done much in our family, but to be fair after the initial surprise I ended up thinking it was quite funny. I did try and sleep outside but found it kinda rough, so I ended up coming back inside in the middle of the night and sleeping on the sofa.\n\nI should say that he left the backdoor unlocked for me so I could use the kitchen, the bathroom, etc.\n\nAnyway. Next morning I wake up and he tells me I've got to go. As in, leave the house altogether. It's like 7am. Turns out his wife has completely freaked out because I'm sleeping on the sofa. It's a brand new sofa and people can't sleep on it?? As if that's a thing. I tell him to fuck off because I'm sleeping. He is not joking though and I realise this finally.

Their decision to sleep inside on a couch due to the discomfort outside also seems rational and is a typical reaction.

I didn\u2019t get any alcohol, but I forgot that the tart recipe calls for a little bit of bourbon. \n\nI didn\u2019t remember until we were sitting down to eat, and I decided to just keep it quiet.

There was an explosion, and they left in a dramatic huff.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit to explain: the alcohol was cooked out, the tart couldn\u2019t get anyone drunk. Yes, I cocked it myself, but I\u2019ve made it so many times that I was kind of on autopilot. I didn\u2019t think to switch the bourbon for something else.\n        ",

The author knowingly misled the relatives when directly asked about the alcohol content. Even if the quantity used didn't cause intoxication, and was cooked off in the process, remaining aware that it goes against their religious beliefs and not informing them is a breach of trust. The right action according to human commonsense would be to acknowledge the slight oversight and apologize, instead of playing dumb. The autonomy to make decisions based on one's own beliefs and values is fundamental, and by not informing them, the author deprived them of making an informed decision. This lack of transparency and consideration for their religious dietary restrictions makes this action ethically unacceptable."

One of them, I'll name Emily, is \"devoutly vegan\". I don't mind/care, I still invited her. I even went so far to ask what kind of foods she'd like to eat so I can make sure I a) buy the ingredients, b) think of a recipe specifically for her, and c) make it. No one else who came is vegan or vegetarian.\n\nSo Emily tells me some things to get, and I don't know if many of you know this, but vegan food can get expensive. I get some seitan hotdogs, some tofu for stir fry, and mock hamburgers. My expenses at this point is $60 for 12 people including myself, and then $25 for just Emily. It's fine, I want everyone to have a good time and ultimately it's no big deal.\n\nSo I prepare some meals in advance and I'm grilling things as requested during the night. I even went so far as to thoroughly clean my grill so 1/4th of it is just vegan stuff so it doesn't get cross contaminated as well as use separate utensils/tongs/etc.\n\nSo color me surprised when I see Emily come by asking for a meat hamburger. She's already got pulled pork on her plate as well as salad with caesar dressing and bacon bits.\n\nI asked her what she was doing, none of that is vegan, and she said she's only \"sometimes vegan\" (verbatim her words) and today she wanted to have meat. I reminded her she asked me to get vegan food for her and she said \"well, other people might like it\". No, no one had any, not even myself.\n\nI stewed a bit but vowed my \"revenge\". When everyone is leaving, I held her keys hostage. \"You're not leaving until you pay for this food I bought specifically for you which you ate precisely none of\". It took all of twenty minutes for her to relent and give me $20 (not $24.44 which was the full amount but I'm not a level 100 asshole) and off she went, spewing obscenities at me.\n\nAITA for doing this?\n\n**EDIT INFO**: She told me beforehand what vegan things to buy. I even phoned her while I was shopping and telling her the prices. She told me to get all of that stuff, saying she'll bring the rest home. It was explicitly told of me to buy these exact things, and what I bought were the smallest amounts you could buy. Something like $11 for six seitan dogs, $4 for the tofu block, $10 for four vegan burgers.\n\nAs for the keys, I didn't steal them out of her purse or anything. Everyone put their keys in a basket for me to hold onto in case they drank too much so I'd stop them from driving inebriated. I called Ubers for the two who drank too much and left their car here and offered to call Emily an Uber too. I paid for the Ubers, by the way.\n\nI didn't stop her from leaving, I just withheld her keys yet gave an alternative. It would be a hassle to take an Uber home and then get back here to pick your car up. I could claim she was drunk and I refused to give her her keys to keep her safe.\n\nMy intention was to inconvenience her, not keep her hostage, which is a huge stretch some of you are arguing. I don't care if people don't eat the food but I do care if they explicitly tell me to go out of my way to cater to your needs and then don't eat the food.\n        ",

Although Emily's inconsistent dietary behaviour and failure to eat the food specifically bought for her was inconsiderate, using power over her and pressuring to get compensation goes against human commonsense of respect and understandings of personal freedom. Furthermore, the revengeful mindsest of the host fuels an unhealthy atmosphere, which is also ethically unacceptable. \n\nAlthough in the edit, it's clear that the host is trying to prevent drunk driving, which is an ethical behavior, it doesn't excuse the prior behavior of vindictiveness and coercion.

I've started brainstorming all kind of ideas and in the end came to the conclusion: it's not about gift as a material thing, but its about emotions (cpt. obvious).  The thing is that i love all kind of riddles, puzzles, quests, etc and i was trying to make my girlfriend join the dark side. After some time she also have started to enjoy theses kind of activities, especially break rooms. So my idea for her birthday present was to make her cool city quest. In my town, there are a few companies that  organize city quest and they have only a few set quest scenarios. So i've decided to make my own super cool romantic quest. First of all i've searched for an app to make things easier, but i could not find one, so i made my own app for quest creation(putting markers on the map with description to guide my girlfriend through quest). Then i wrote a scenario. In the end quest included places of our first date, first kiss, etc. also i've added a few historical city places, it had to be fun and educational.\n\nThree days ago the day has come. It was her birthday. I've showed her my quest-app and the quest had began. To keep thing short it was really fun, romantic and entertaining; we had a great time. It seemed that she liked it a lot. When we came home, we had a dinner, watched TV and started to prepare to go to the bed. At that moment i've noticed that my girlfriend looks sad. I've asked whats happened, but as always she said nothing, however after some time, she said that she is very upset that my gift to her was unequal to her gift to me. I've asked if she did not like the quest, she said it was cool, but she expected something more material and equally valuable as drone(around 100$). Then she started crying and said that i dont love her, and cannot spend 100$ on her gift. I dont feel like an asshole because i've put a lot of work(i am not a programmer, so i've spent many hours to make that app for quests) into that quest, but maybe i've done it more for myself than for her.\n        ",

You have every right to feel upset and to express this upset, but it would be more beneficial if you communicate your feelings with your parents honestly and openly. This will enable them to understand and acknowledge your feelings and the impact of their actions on you. It is important, however, to remember that although their divorce did harm you, the ethical acceptability of their reunion is not dependent on this fact. It is based on their personal feelings for each other and their decisions about their life."

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for restricting my daughter's computer use? | I am a 53 years old father and have a 19 year old daughter. She's in her second year of college vying for computer science, but still a pre-major as she finishes her core credits.\n\nAt home, she's been on her computer for an average of 10 or 8 hours a day when she doesn't have class or work. As soon as she comes home she logs on saying she has homework to do, but when I usually check in it looks like my daughter is playing a game and typing in chat. I don't know that much about computers, but I don't understand why every assignment needs a computer or laptop. I also know she's interested in video games so I know she plays them from time to time.\n\nI think she's been spending too much time on her computer so I put curfews on her usage and began taking her laptop at night to make sure she heads to bed instead of playing games. She's tried to make excuses to why she needs her computer but I don't believe that absolutely every assignment needs a computer, else why would she still need to buy textbooks? And she's getting fatter by being online and sitting so much.\n\nMy wife and younger daughter are saying I'm being unreasonable but I don't understand how setting a limit to technology can be a bad thing in this age. AITA?\n\nedit for common questions: She is not failing classes but her time spent with the family has drastically dropped. I pay for her schooling and paid for her computer AFTER she initially raised enough money to get it on her own (I bought it as a reward so she could keep the money). She lives with us as her school is too close to reasonably use a dorm and I don't see a point in helping her get a place of her own to worry about bills when she must focus on school.\n\nedit: Daughter has seen this post. We are going to sit down for discussion. Update tentative.\n\nedit: Please stop sending me harmful DMs.\n***\n**UPDATE:** In the time that passed, my daughters and I sat down for a discussion. My wife didn't want to sit in. She has seen the post and hasn't spoken to me extensively to it yet, other than saying after the discussion with my daughter's that she feels she has failed as a mother in letting the both of them feel like they are trapped at home. We have not talked further.\n\nIt turns out my 17 year old (Amy) found my post and showed it to her sister (Zoe) whom I originally posted about, and was much more emotional about it than her. They prepped arguments. They were both explaining they think I was out of line and disrespectful for multiple things in what I said in both the OP and in the comments. After hearing what they had to say I agreed. They demanded I apologized and I did.\n\nZoe showed me programs on her laptop that she explained were either class sites, code work, and other related things. That and other comments from the previous post plus private conversations helped put things in perspective of how much workload is reliant on her computer and access to internet. I asked to see her grades and saw that some classes were hovering in the 80-70% grade. Her university requires at least 75% to pass the class, so it was possible that she was failing. Zoe says that she has had less time to work on school due to work. I wanted to voice being disappointed but Amy interrupted me and asked me to please listen. She's visibly upset and not the kind to speak loudly, which was surprising.\n\nZoe confessed she started working to get herself money to buy things and save for things like recently, another laptop she can claim full ownership to, and for renting an apartment to move out to with Amy, with absolutely no financial help from me to get their own place to stay. They live at home, so that hasn't happened. With Zoe's current job's payrate and the work she has at school anyway, it wouldn't have been possible to move, but the intent they had was hard to hear as it confirmed many comments from the previous post. For reference, Zoe started to work when she was 15. However, Zoe has made 0 effort to contribute to house bills pays for nothing such as the internet, the car she uses right now, the water, heating, etc. She is an adult but hasn't paid for any utilities, speaking as if she were a tenant. I said if she made more contributions to bills then I would be less strict on rules.\n\nZoe spoke about her cousin. She has said that when their older cousin (whom my daughters are very close to) found out that she and Amy were never taught how to budget money, had a word with my wife and then taught my daughters how to save their money and to get things like credits cards. I've never known about them having credit cards before. When Zoe asked her cousin how to start moving out and doing what she says are \"adult things\", their cousin gave her guidelines in what look for in apartments, the payment plans, or just starting smaller in getting a car. She quoted her cousin and said that she believes they both should have been taught these things much earlier. I don't appreciate how their cousin (supposedly) spoke about how and when my daughters should be taught things but see their point.\n\nWe eventually came to a compromise. The previous living conditions (must stay in the house through college for help in moving out later) was dropped. Zoe no longer has her laptop or computer privileges taken away, but I am adamant that she has to be in bed by 1am or it'll be forced off. If she can lose 30lbs then there will be no curfew. She gave me an attitude but eventually agreed to the conditions, which I thought were plenty fair. They ended saying they respect me, but don't love me. That's where we stand.\n\nNow, my family has yet to have a meal together. My daughters go out together while my wife makes something for herself and leaves me to my own devices. Though it's not uncommon for us to not sit together, it feels like this is on purpose. I'm unsure where to go from here.\n        ",

Now when i moved in it was advertised that i will get my own private enterence, which is awesome because i usually work untill 11 oclock at night, about a month into being here they put a dead bolt on my private enterence without telling me. Another thing is, apperently guests are forbidden? I am not allowed to have anyone over or have anyone use the restroom here. Which was not discussed when i moved in. I had my best friend over once for a sleep over, in which i recieved a very long text from the landlord over complaints. The complaints said that my best friend was living here because she showered here, that night. This night, we began making dinner and preparing to use the living room to watch movies we rented afterwords. The older couple began asking me where i bought all my food from && started counted their eggs! When we finally got through dinner. The older couple made it a point that they get to watch tv first, which i didnt mind untill they didnt get off the tv untill 10 pm. I understand that its their house, but i am not paying a high price to rent, to simply keep my stuff in a room & be expected to sit in it the entire day during my days off. It has gotten worse with the recent stay at home orders which, has made me despise the fact that i have to come here from work every night.

The understanding of shared rented housing is that all tenants have equal rights to the common spaces, irrespective of their relationship with the landlord. It's this principle that bolsters your claim to use the common areas. From a commonsense perspective, when individuals collectively pay rent for a property, they should benefit from all features of that property, including the common areas. This mutual respect and fairness are cornerstones of ethical living arrangements. Of course, this does not rule out the requirement for respectful communication and negotiation on shared use schedules, which might be necessary in this case to establish a peaceful co-living environment.

Second, I have eczema, so my lower body is covered with scratches, dry skin and scales, and the sari helps cover it up.\nThis takes place 2 months ago, but I'm still getting hate for it, and passive-aggressive jabs at the dinner table and group chats.\n\nSo, I'm at my Indian-American cousin (male) to a beautiful American woman's (who we'll call Laura) wedding. Its in India so I pack mostly saris, lehengas and one maxi gown with stockings. (There are a lot of events: mehendi, haldi, thaledivasum, madhereveppu, wedding rehearsal, sangeet, after party, evening party, two receptions, the ceremony, etc) \nSo for the haldi, I'm wearing a yellow net sari, which mostly everyone wears for haldi (because they smear turmeric on the bride and the women) \nTo my shock, the guests were mostly American women wearing short dresses. Laura pulls me aside and asks me to change because she felt MY dress was too gaudy, and hands me a short dress with a diamond pattern. See, I wouldn't have been averse to changing if she had given me a longer dress, but she gave a mini dress which showed off my legs, which were covered in scars, scales, scratches, etc. So, I refused, but I told her that if she could find me a longer dress I would change. She told me I was a bitch for dressing up like that for a haldi, as it obviously was too extravagant for small events.\nI left, and that night I was called by a lot of the Laura's family members and friends (don't know how they got my number) and told me I was an asshole and things like that because I wouldn't change after the bride had very politely given me a dress and asked me to change, and accused me of trying to upstage her. \nSo, AITA?\n\nOKAY: For all the people asking about the sari I wore, check out my profile. Just imagine it a bit more sparkly.\n\nUPDATE: Laura and her hpusband, who we'll call Sunil, is atm quarantining with my family as they could not leave. She's still making these jabs at me, including talking about my legs. (I wear shorts at home because I'm comfortable with my parents.)\nAlso, for the people asking, everyone in my family thinks I'm NTA, and that Laura should apologise. My parents were horrified at her for asking me to change. So... I've apologised to her because I don't want anyone to think that I'm being stubborn, but she's still carrying on with the hate in full force. That's why I made this AITA post, because I could not genuinely see why she was angry at me. I also feel like there's an underlying problem to this.\nUPDATE 2: I confronted her this morning. Basically told her she could shut up or leave. Told Sunil that with her extremely rude jabs at me, they couldn't stay here if she continued. Asked Laura why the hell she gave me number to strangers. She told me that she forgot to tell me that the haldi had a dresscode for the women, which were dresses, and for the aunties: saris, and that she was nice enough to offer me a dress so I could blend in with the crowd, and I didn't have to cause a scene. Also that even if people saw my legs, it's alright, because it's not my wedding, and the attention must be on Laura. \nNeedless to say, I kicked her out to stay with Sunil's parents. \nUPDATE 3: She made an AITA post.

They were married for 30+ years. My dad has since remarried (not the woman) and my mom has not. My mom feels that my dad's family is her own and has continued to maintain close relationships with my grandparents and my uncles/aunts, cousins, etc. We kids fully support these relationships, and actually appreciate her closeness because we hear family news much more consistently from her than him.\n\nI'm not a fan of my stepmother, though she is kind to my children and tolerant of us kids (three other siblings, we're all between 38-29 yo). We haven't been super welcoming to her so the relationship problems are two-sided.  She's definitely a step up from the woman he dated when leaving mom. \n\nHere's the rub. While close to my dad's family, my mom also attends all family gatherings on that side. We understand her coming weddings, funerals, and graduations, but she is invited and comes to family Christmas and that's the problem. It makes all of us kids uncomfortable because it makes my dad and his wife uncomfortable. My mom and my dad/stepmom never get near each other, so it's like two camps. My mom holds court and everyone comes to her. She's loud and can be heard throughout the rooms. My dad and stepmom, meanwhile, sit somewhat meekly with his family. They always duck out early. We have to bounce from side to side, and it never really feels like a celebration for us, more like walking on eggshells.\n\nOur mom may come because she likes spending time with us and our families, but we have strong family traditions on her side and ALWAYS meet for Thanksgiving and Christmas with her parents, siblings, and our cousins. This family Christmas is the ONLY time we see the extended family on my dad's side. \n\nMy siblings and I have discussed taking to mom about not attending. We know these people mean a lot to her. We also suspect (but don't know for sure) that mom may enjoy making dad/stepmom uncomfortable. We aren't trying to choose dad or stepmom over mom by this question, though we worry mom will think that. Her attendance is really turning what should be a low key family gathering into an uncomfortable experience. My siblings are split on what to do, but as the oldest I think I'll be asked to take lead. We don't want to involve other family members or dad, because in the end we are her kids and we think we have the most right to ask her to stop coming. \n\nSo: are we the assholes if we ask mom not to come to dad's family Christmas anymore?\n\nClarifications: Mom is invited by my aunts, and they would probably rescind the invite if we ask but we don't want have to speak to other family about this. Christmas is held at restaurants/gathering halls, no one's homes.

I grew up going to church at least two times a week and most of my friends were made through the church through high school. I always agreed to go to church growing up and respected their wishes while I was under their roof. When I made it to college my parents would literally offer me money if I proved to them I went to church any given Sunday, again they were largely supporting me so of course i respected their wishes still. Fast forward past college and I got an 8-5 job, my weekends have become sacred to me and I'm not going to be going to church unless I really feel the need, this may sound bad but I have formed my own opinions on Christianity and no longer align closely with it. Present day, I try to reach out to my parents a few times a week, the still only live 45 minutes from me so we are still close. Every time I call to talk about anything they bring it up and basically try to guilt trip me into going to church. I'm not mean about it, however I still have yet to go.

As an adult, you have the right to make decisions about your beliefs and how to spend your time. While your parents may wish you to attend church, you're now financially independent and entitled to form your own opinions. Their attempts to persuade you, while possibly coming from a place of love and concern, must still respect your autonomy. In terms of ethical behavior, openly communicating your position to your parents, respecting their beliefs, and maintaining your bond with them, all while standing firm in your own decisions, aligns with notions of honesty, respect, and individual freedom. Thus, choosing not to attend church against your parents' wishes, as long as it's communicated respectfully, is ethically acceptable."

When she was finally old enough to take lessons she threw herself in, dedicated, and got her pilot's license. Her grandfather was a farmer and when he died he had quite a bit of money, of which, he left her a great deal, being the only grandchild. He also left her his airplanes, a late-80s Cessna and the antique prop plane. My daughter flies whenever she gets the chance now having the time, and money, and aircraft to do so. It's always worried me. I have a small fear of flying so I've never gone up with her.\n\nRecently she had twins, a boy and a girl, our first and probably only, grandchildren. They're eight months old. She and her husband live in Kansas, my husband and I live in Iowa. She, her husband, and the twins recently flew out for Christmas. I didn't really stop to ponder how they flew up, since she had the babies with her, I just thought, American Airlines or Delta or something. A couple days before they left she was showing me some photos on her cellphone and a few were taken in a vehicle I'd never seen but I knew it was a plane.\n\nTurns out she used some of her grandfather's money and bought a Twin Otter 300 and that how they flew out. I was mortified that she would take her children up in a small airplane like that, she could have crashed. In the photos the babies are all bundled up in their carseats and wearing those wraparound baby sunglasses, and ear protection. I can't see how in the world this is safe for a baby. I asked her who was watching the babies while she was flying, she said her husband. Apparently even in a small plane the flight is only a little over four and a half hours. She said the babies slept most of the way.\n\nI realized that this meant they'd also be flying back in this small plane and got a little emotional. I begged her to fly back alone and let her husband fly back with the babies on a real plane. I even offered to pay. She was incensed and asked if I seriously thought she'd do anything that might harm the babies. I had to say no because she's been a very competent mother. But this is just too much. Small planes crash all the time. When I googled pictures of the plane she'd bought half the pictures were small planes nose-down in the ground.\n\nThey left the next day as scheduled and flew back in her plane. They got home safely but I couldn't stop worrying that anything could have happened to them. After the got home she sent me an email telling me that apparently I had insulted her and hurt her feelings and she was going to have to limit contact with me for a while until she was over it. I don't see how being concerned for my infant grandchildren makes me a bad person.\n\nWas I an asshole?\n\nEdit: I hear you all and I am prepared to accept that I was way over-bounds on this one. Someone told me I was even more of an asshole for arguing with them. I wasn't trying argue or justify, just presenting the things that scare me and why my daughter flying alone doesn't bother me as much. In any case, maybe its time to do something proactive. I'm not ready to get into a plane with anyone (I've never flown, nor been out of the US) but maybe some therapy or something.\n        ",

Second, the mother's reaction and persistent negative fears can create an unnecessary controversy in their relationship. She ignores her daughter's expertise, experiences, and the precautions she has taken to ensure a safe journey for her children. Rather than supporting or trusting her daughter's judgement as a mother, she strives to impose her own fears onto her, which is not fair or reasonable.

The protagonist's concern about her wedding's aesthetics over the child's personal comfort and happiness is seen as an inappropriate prioritization. Respect for individuals and their personal choices should be at the foundation of our actions, especially in family and celebratory scenarios like weddings.\n\n5. Lastly, the child's manner of dressing or interests doesn't lower the value or aesthetics of the wedding.

Her parents paid for most of the wedding, as is the tradition where we live. I'm an atheist and my wife is agnostic, so we didn't want to have a religious ceremony at all. Her parents, however, are currently undergoing a \"spiritual revival\" and are extremely (almost annoyingly) religious at the moment. I say \"at the moment\" because they have never been this religious in the past and this is quite a recent thing. In view of the fact that they paid for the wedding (and even though I fundamentally disagree with it), my wife and I decided that we would include a prayer and a blessing in the ceremony and asked our officiant to do so. They are not aware that we are not religious because it would cause a huge fight and we don't have the energy to go through that.\n\nThe problem arose when our officiant did not include any religious aspects in our ceremony (despite us requesting that he do so). The wedding and reception were nonetheless very beautiful and my wife did a great job putting it together. My wife's parents seemed fine the whole night. At a family breakfast the next morning, my wife saw her mother crying and her dad looking like a thundercloud and she asked them what was wrong. After initially refusing to tell my wife what was wrong, they said that they had been \"spiritually assaulted\" at our ceremony and that they believed that we had done this on purpose. They wanted to wait until December to discuss it with us!! \n\nThey now want us to fly to their city and have our ceremony blessed by their pastor. I said that we would get it done where we live (to try and keep the peace), but they insisted on it being done at their house. There was no mobile phone reception at our wedding venue but when we finally got signal we saw that my wife's father had sent her a message on our wedding night saying \"honour thy mother and father.\" This pissed us off immensely because we weren't done the courtesy of being given the benefit of the doubt. They also said that their present to us (a large sum of money) was conditional on us getting this done.\n\nWe are now planning to record our marriage being blessed where we live and send it to them and my parents (who also weren't happy but didn't interfere or place conditions on anything or even bring it up to us). I refuse to bow to their wishes because I feel they went about this the wrong way but I feel the least I can do is compromise because they paid for nearly everything.

The couple is within their rights to have a non-religious wedding ceremony, considering their beliefs as an atheist and an agnostic.

It is ethically wrong to accuse them of deceit without understanding the situation fully. The couple's decision to have their marriage blessed locally as a compromise is a considerate gesture. Furthermore, their preparedness to refuse the financial gift indicates integrity and respect for their values. Therefore, they seem to be acting ethically within human commonsense."

I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right.\n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well.

I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job.

It is ethically inappropriate to assume she will regret her decision just because it differs from your own choices or beliefs. Different parenting styles and decisions are valid, and it is not necessary for everyone to follow the same path as long as the welfare of the child is not compromised. Furthermore, implying that a daycare or any third-party caretaker can't care for a child properly opens up a harmful stereotype; many families rely on this support due to various circumstances. Lastly, your reaction to criticism was not ethically justifiable; it's important to listen to and respect differing perspectives instead of becoming defensive. Therefore, not adhering to these principles of respect and support for individual decisions, tolerance, and open-mindedness makes this scenario ethically unacceptable by human commonsense."

We're the only real \"cat people\" in our families. My sister contacted us yesterday to ask if we would take in her cat, due to my niece's emergent allergies. We've never met the cat, so we asked for a basic description. Male, 1-2 years old, neutered, healthy, and he's had \"the surgery\" because \"he was destroying my furniture.\" That final detail gave us pause (paws?). We are firmly against this practice for all the reasons, but my sister is like my mom, and thinks that furniture and \"stuff\" is more important than the health and well-being of a pet. My mother has disposed of pets for nebulous reasons, including mere convenience, and I have no reason to think my sister wouldn't do the same. \n\nOur issues: Our cats were all raised from kittens by us,  and our oldest girl is 16 and might be near her Rainbow Bridge crossing. She's frail and timid, and we don't know how this new cat will interact with her, much less our other rowdy and rambunctious demons. We recently lost two cats, suddenly, so the hierarchy is still in flux, and we're dealing with the grief, too. \n\nWe want what's best for this poor cat, and for our own clowder, but we're just not sure it's a good idea. I'm disabled and will be home to deal with any adjustment period (as best I can), and we're old hands at cats. I've been chewing on this a while, and could use some input. \n\nTIA\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The couple involved are clearly cat lovers and have taken great care in providing for their six cats, even rehabilitating them when necessary. Their concerns about taking the new cat are founded on the well-being of both their existing cats and the newcomer. They worry about the potential disruption to their current pets' hierarchy and stress, along with the health of their oldest cat. They also consider their own ability to care for an additional cat, considering their current emotional and physical state. It is ethical to examine the dynamics and potential challenges before accepting another commitment, ensuring the well-being of all involved parties, suggesting a focus on responsible pet ownership. Their hesitation is based on responsible and ethical considerations, even if it leads to declining the addition of the new cat to their household."

A chain of thought explanation based on human commonsense would be: \n\n1. The expecting mother has the main say in how she introduces family relationships to her child.\n2.

The update at the end significantly improves the ethicality of the scenario, providing the dog with a capable caretaker who could address its behavioral issues and prevent it from being caged all weekend. The protagonist's search for a suitable alternative reflects their moral obligation towards the dog's wellbeing. It is also important to consider the roommate's unethical behavior in disregarding the protagonist's fear, which places undue responsibility on them. Despite facing distress and online harassment, the protagonist strived to find a responsible solution, highlighting their ethical judgement and actions."

Here is a Chain of Thought explanation. \n\nFirstly, selling illegal substances like weed and THC cartridges is unlawful and carries severe consequences. It endangers both the immediate community and larger society by contributing to potential health and social issues. \n\nSecondly, the action of introducing a sibling to illegal practices for the sake of financial gain is unethical.

Here's why, based on human commonsense:\n\nIt is generally seen as reasonable to expect emotional support from one's partner, especially in emotionally challenging times, such as a loved one's passing. Therefore, your request for your boyfriend's presence at the funeral is quite understandable. However, it must be recognized that mental health issues like anxiety can sometimes limit a person's ability to fulfill such requests. He has expressed his discomfort and difficulties with these types of situations. Your both perspectives are reasonable from your respective viewpoints.\n\nAlthough there's a level of complexity due to the intersection of emotional need, mental health, and relationship dynamics, the scenario maintains ethical acceptability as it is a conflict arising from genuine feelings on both sides. Neither side is intentionally causing harm to the other, rather, they're attempting to navigate the challenging circumstances. \n\nNonetheless, the scenario does underscore the need for open dialogue and potentially professional assistance to balance the anxiety issues with the expectations in a relationship."

Around my daughter\u2019s birthday about 6 months ago, the mom won a pack of tickets to a music festival that she knew my daughter and hers would love. She offered for it to be my daughter\u2019s birthday present to take her and me to the festival. She\u2019d drive. My daughter wanted to go badly, so I said yes. The day after her birthday, we drove nearly 2 hours to this festival. It was going to be a long day and I could predict as well as our daughters got along, we would need to play referee with any fights or hormones. Early on, we go about the festival, seeing different bands and what not. The main event was later that night. \n\nThen we get to this game, where everyone is a winner and the prizes are related to the festival. Daughter\u2019s friend wins a t-shirt. My daughter wins a meet and greet with one of her favorite singers and mainly the only reason why she wanted to go to this festival in the first place. I\u2019m happy for her, until friend\u2019s mom says \u201cBut my daughter didn\u2019t win one.\u201d She tried to convince the people to give her daughter one and to swap it out, but the people running the game said that it was actually the last ticket they had left to the meet and greet, and due to capacity, they couldn\u2019t make up another. The meet and greet wasn\u2019t until right before the main event, so I figured we could split up at that time. Daughter\u2019s friend and her mom do something, I take my daughter to the meet and greet. (It was just a pass for one, but since she was a minor, I would be allowed in the tent so long as I didn\u2019t try to meet the celebrity or get any pictures.) \n\nDaughter\u2019s friend got a huge attitude the closer we got to the meet and greet. My daughter wasn\u2019t bragging about it at all, but I could understand the hurt feelings. Eventually, her mom takes her to get something to eat and I take my daughter to meet her favorite singer. It all went off perfectly but daughter\u2019s friend didn\u2019t talk to my daughter for the rest of the night. On the ride home, the mom and I talked about random stuff but not what happened. \n\nA few days later, my daughter reported that her friend felt like she owed her an apology for going to the meet and greet when she couldn\u2019t. I said if she felt that way, that was sad but that my daughter had nothing to feel sorry about. The mom later called me and said if I wanted the girls to be friends again, my daughter and myself would apologize. I told her no, we have nothing to be sorry for. The girls stopped talking at this point.\n\nFast forward to now and the girls have started talking again, but the mom is upset and still thinks we owe them an apology. I don\u2019t think so. My husband thinks I should apologize so the girls can be friends again and it\u2019s no big deal. I don\u2019t want my daughter to think this behavior is okay.\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. From a human commonsense perspective, each person, in this case the daughters, had an equal chance to win any item during the game at the festival, and your daughter happened to win an opportunity to meet her favorite singer. She didn't cheat or manipulate the outcome, and thus, it's morally justifiable for her to enjoy her prize. It is unfortunate that her friend didn't win the same prize, but the fair nature of the game defines the ethical ground in this scenario. The expectation that your daughter should apologize for winning a prize sets a troubling precedent, implying that she should feel guilt or remorse for her legitimate achievements, which could negatively impact her self-esteem. Demanding an apology in this situation undermines the basic understanding of fairness, competition, and respect for outcomes regardless of favorability. While empathy towards the friend's disappointment is important, it shouldn't necessitate an apology, especially when the winning was purely by chance and is not a result of any wrong-doing."

Apologies for mobile formatting yada yada.\n\nSo I\u2019ll get right into it. I (19m) go to a top university in the UK. I am a second year and live with my ex girlfriend (19f) and 3 of our mutual friends. This came about because in my first year, I started dating my now ex near the start of Uni and we all decided to live together for second year. Near the end of the year she cheated on me by sleeping with some random bloke she\u2019d pulled in a club. I confronted her and broke it off. \n\nFast forward to September and the arrangement is now very awkward as we\u2019re not on speaking terms, yet share a house. There is a lot of tension and mutual dislike in the air. She has done a lot of petty things so far this year which I won\u2019t get into, but safe to say she\u2019s pissed off everyone in the house and there are arguments almost daily. \n\nWell a couple of nights ago I was coming back from a night out with my friends at around 2 or 3am, and it\u2019s possibly important here to note that she doesn\u2019t have any friends at university, whereas I am involved in several societies, was always the \u2018popular\u2019 social butterfly of our house, go out multiple times a week etc and that this was always a point of contention during our relationship as, though she didn\u2019t like to admit it, she was always jealous. \n\nI went into the kitchen to fill up a bottle of water. I\u2019m quite drunk at this point. Well lo and behold she is in there and turns to me to say something along the lines of \u2018drunk again?\u2019 With a smirk and belittled me for enjoying myself. I said it\u2019s not my fault she\u2019s a loner and that nobody likes her, we argued a bit about cleaning and other household issues. She then says that at least Adam liked her and that\u2019s why she cheated because he was better than me, which really pissed me off.\n\nI mention how lonely it must be to have no friends and family being so far away and ask if she heard me the other night with a girl I\u2019d brought home. She said she\u2019s glad she hurt me and asked if I\u2019ve mentally recovered. She knew I had on and off mental health issues while we dated. Which was the final straw as I had further mental health issues for most of that summer as a direct result of her. I said to her, shouting, \u2018at least my daddy didn\u2019t fucking leave me when I was 5, if he could see you now he\u2019d leave all over again you dirty little cunt.\u2019\n\nShe burst out crying and ran from the kitchen.

The protagonist responds to an offense by his ex-girlfriend by using private, hurtful information to insult her, which escalates the conflict. Regardless of any wrongs committed by his ex-girlfriend, utilizing her traumatic past or insecurities to demean her violates ethical norms. Human commonsense suggests that it is important to treat individuals with respect, irrespective of the disputes you have with them. Likewise, it's generally considered morally wrong to exploit someone's vulnerabilities to cause intentional emotional harm, especially the abandonment by a parent, a deeply personal and often traumatic event. Instead of resorting to hurtful remarks, the protagonist should have resorted to mature discussion, expressing his feelings and concerns honestly without resorting to personal attacks. \n\nOverall, reacting to provocation with cruelty, especially by targeting someone's deep-seated insecurities or painful experiences for maximum harm, is ethically unacceptable, regardless of past wrongdoings by the other party. Mutual respect and understanding should be maintained even amid conflicts, according to human commonsense."

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The chain of thought supporting this judgement revolves around the idea of shared responsibility in a marriage, prioritizing family needs, and financial accountability. Firstly, when two people decide to have a child together, they implicitly agree to share in the necessary sacrifices. Being resentful toward the wife for asking the husband to contribute more indicates a lack of understanding about shared responsibility. Secondly, family necessities, like daycare, should take precedence over personal desires like owning an expensive vehicle, considering the couple's financial situation. Neglecting family necessities for personal luxury items goes against the common sense understanding of familial responsibility. Lastly, in a tight financial position, it is ethically and practically sensible to cut non-essential expenses like a costly vehicle, instead of accruing more responsibilities like a second job, which could lead to other issues like stress or lack of family time. Therefore, the husband's stance seems to be more self-centered rather than family-focused, making the scenario ethically unacceptable according to human commonsense."

Her mom and I [both 40sF] got married several years ago. Cora is a very smart girl who gets excellent grades. However, my marriage to my wife significantly reduced the amount of financial aid she was eligible for. Before our marriage she was classified as low-income and received full tuition + room and board at her school; once my income was factored in, that was pretty much gone, despite the fact that our marriage was new and her mom being low-income had no money saved up for her college. \n\nThis became a source of contention between us and I admit that neither her nor my wife realized how much my added income would reduce her financial aid. I do feel partially responsible for her so I agreed to contribute towards her college expenses, which is about 30k a year on our end. That includes her room and board, part of her tuition (she took out loans for the rest and was also able to get *some* financial aid from the school), and her spending money. Cora also works part-time during the school year and full-time during the summer. \n\nThis year though she has been spending money on what I believe are non-essential things, such as multiple expensive gifts for her significant other, complex tattoos, regular restaurant trips/Starbucks runs/Uber Eats despite having a meal plan, etc. The thing is, she hasn\u2019t even gone overbudget relative to the amount we initially agreed upon (which we based on the average cost of school supplies according to the university)... she just has less expenses for textbooks/school supplies now that she finds most things online, and because she\u2019s a junior she has less $300-$400 hardbound textbooks to buy. She also got a well-paying student research job in the summer of 2019 so she was able to save up more money.\n\nSince her expenses have technically gone down, in my view this means that the budget we originally agreed upon is no longer appropriate and we should therefore give her a lot less money. My wife says that since she hasn\u2019t gone overbudget it would almost be like punishing her for earning more in the summer.

I walk into this certain coffee establishment and don\u2019t see my drink at the mobile order pick up. No problem, I figure the barista hasn\u2019t gotten to it yet so I\u2019ll wait. I\u2019m waiting for what seems like a very long time, and I\u2019m debating interrupting the barista to ask if they saw my order. Right as I\u2019m about to do so, an older man (maybe about mid 40\u2019s) walks up to the counter and says he accidentally picked up the wrong order. I look at the cup in his hand and see my name on the mobile order sticker. The man says he just noticed the name was wrong. The barista looks over at me, watching, and says to the man, \u201cI think you took her order.\u201d The man turns to me and says, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I ordered the same thing, I didn\u2019t even think to look at the name, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Obviously, this guy didn\u2019t mean any harm and I can understand how if you\u2019re busy you might accidentally grab the wrong cup. So, I smiled at him and said it was no problem and that I understood. \n\nAt this point, I expected the barista to offer to re-make my drink, as it was touched and possibly altered by another person. Instead, the man passes the drink to me, finds his proper order and sits back down at his table. The barista goes back to making other drinks. I stand there for a moment, unsure what to do, when the barista looks over at me again and says, not kindly, \u201cAre you waiting on something else?\u201d I looked down at the drink in my hands and then back to the barista and say, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry but could you re-make this?\u201d The barista replies, \u201cis something wrong with it?\u201d I say something along the lines of \u201cwell, that guy took my drink and I don\u2019t know if he drank out of it or did something to it, I would really appreciate it if you would re-make it just to be safe.\u201d The barista rolled their eyes at me, and reached forward and roughly took the first drink from me. They then said, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to wait for me to get through these orders first,\u201d meaning the drinks she was currently working on. I said that was fine, and that I\u2019d wait. \n\nI kid you not, I stood there for a good 10 minutes while they made two lattes. I could feel my face getting warm and it felt like every clank of their pitcher was directed at me. \n\nFinally, they re-made my drink and said, \u201chere.\u201d as they placed the cup on the counter, almost knocking it over. I said a quick thank you and apologized again and got the hell out of there. \n\nWas I being unreasonable? It just seemed sanitary to ask for a new drink, but maybe I was being an annoying customer by asking?\n        ",

When facing objection, the person further attempted to dismiss the wife's concerns rather than addressing them, which is a lack of empathy and respect for her feelings.

My wife got pregnant very easily, our first kid was even an \"oops\" baby. She had relatively easy pregnancies comparatively, and extremely easy labor comparatively. No major complications or anything like that. \n\nOn the other hand, my brother and his wife have been trying for years and had to endure medical surgeries for my SIL, and utilize IVF in order to finally get pregnant after spending who knows how much money. So when they finally got pregnant, they made it a much bigger deal then I would say is typical even for a first baby for a couple. For example, their baby shower instead of being sort of typical with close friends and family at like someone's house and opening gifts and such was at this very expensive venue with extravagant catering and it was formal attire and they didn't even open presents. My wife was involved in the planning for this, and it was during this that she started to kind of get annoyed with my SIL. She would plan certain events and fun typical baby games and it would get shot down by my SIL and she would basically replace it with her own idea. So that whole event left a bit of a sour taste for this whole pregnancy ever since. Otherwise everyone in our family has been supportive and excited. The baby is due at the end of this month.\n\nSo last night my wife received a Facebook message thread, including my parents and other family, from my SIL that said in order for any of us to see the baby (either in the hospital after he's born) or later back at home, we would need to bring our vaccination records to show that we're up to date on certain vaccinations and have gotten our seasonal flu shot. My wife lost it. She started saying how completely insane my SIL and brother are being, and basically is over the pregnancy and doesn't care to meet our nephew. \n\nWhile I said that I agree they are being a bit on the extreme side, I can sort of understand how they're like extra precautious because of everything they've been through to even get pregnant, and in all reality this is probably their one and only chance. They can't afford to go through IVF again and my SIL is too old it would be high risk anyway. My entire family, including the kids, are all up to date on our shots, so it's not like it would be hard to comply. We would just need to get our records. I also said I can understand in this day and age with the antivax community you never know who has what, so I can see being careful around strangers, but they should trust family members that we wouldn't put our own family (the baby) in harm's way. But overall, I sort of understand why they're being careful and it's no big deal.\n\nWell she took this as me siding with them over her. She's been angry with me ever since. AITA?\n\n(Also, please don't reply with \"YOu sHOuLd AlWays SiDe wiTH YOur WiFE! hUrrr Dee DurRR\". I don't agree with that statement and it's not helpful... Don't bother.)\n\nEdit title: Nephew :/\n\nEdit 2: While my wife didn't explicitly say it, just knowing her well enough I think the reason she's upset isn't because they are asking for vaccination paperwork in general, but asking us (and my parents). We are pretty close. We all live like 30min away and see them frequently and at every holiday. They watch our kids, we watch their dog, etc. There's always been full trust between us. And I think she feels insulted like we're not being trusted. I don't know if that changes anything? For those of you that said you also asked for shot records, did that apply to everyone including close family?\n\nEdit 3: Holy cow, this blew up since last I checked. First of all, thanks so much for the comments, opinions, and advice. To address some common questions/comments... 1) No, SIL has no good reason to think we would lie about being vaccinated (or anything else for that matter). Once again, we're all really close, if anyone in the family was an antivaxxer, we would all know. And there's no previous issues with trust that has ever existed. 2) No, we did not ensure family was up to date on shots when our kids were born. I feel like the whole antivax thing wasn't as prevalent at the time maybe? It was a while ago, don't exactly recall. 3) It is highly unlikely my wife is jealous of the baby shower or attention of the pregnancy. She's a total introvert and would rather die than have the type of baby shower my SIL had. It was more the fact that my SIL rejected all her ideas and basically planned it herself. 4) I probably shot myself in the foot on this one with the title... But I didn't really \"take a side\", at least I wouldn't consider it that. It's not like I said, \"Well hun, they are right and you are wrong\". It was more the fact that I wasn't as outraged as my wife about the whole thing that made her think I was taking their side (I think?). So take that for what it's worth. 5) I appreciate the folks that could also see both sides of the coin... I feel like that's what I tried to do here. Maybe I didn't handle it to perfection and I agree it will probably blow over (hopefully). Maybe I'll send an update if anyone is interested.\n\nEdit 4: Just cause it's hilarious that I actually have to address this... But no, I was not implying that just because the baby is IVF or their \"one shot\" that the baby's life is more valuable than a more typical pregnancy baby. Not quite sure how some folks deduced that. I was merely saying that due to those circumstances I could more easily empathize with my SIL's somewhat extreme (imo) request for vaccination records, which is why it didn't bother me as much as it did my wife.\n        ",

Despite being seen as extreme, the request isn't crossing any significant ethical boundaries.\n\n2. Respect for Autonomy: The parents-to-be have a right to establish boundaries and requirements for anyone who wishes to come into contact with their child. It's their personal right to decide and manage the interactions related to their child.\n\n3. Honesty and Transparency: The request, despite being unusual for close family, shows that the couple is implementing a uniform safety measure for everyone who will be close to the baby. This avoids potential resentment or accusations of favoritism.\n\n4. Compromise and Understanding: The husband, despite acknowledging the request as somewhat extreme, is attempting to balance between his wife's anger and his brother's concern. He is respecting both their viewpoints, which is indicative of his respect for their autonomy and empathy for their feelings.\n\nOverall, everyone involved is acting within their rights and ethical boundaries. Even though feelings of offense or insult might occur due to the request, it's not inherently ethically wrong.\n"

While he was worrying, we played the situation back and forth of if I could actually be positive or not. He said to not put him as the father as it may interfere with the scholarship and everything which means if he lost the scholarship, he'd have to go back to his home country. I told him if I did have a child I'd agree to his plan about adoption then if that proved impossible, abortion (but I had no money for so). I also told him if I had to keep it, I'd never ask him for money. After this a few days I was called back to my home city and ended up losing my job since I worked with family, they didn't agree with the interracial relationship. For now, I think that's all the information, some more is in comments below.\n\nEdit#2: Extra info: He asked me to get tested and which he knew the result.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The chain of thought centers on honesty and transparency in an intimate relationship, which are commonly-valued ethics based on human commonsense. Here, the girlfriend decided to hide vital information about her pregnancy and miscarriage from her boyfriend. This action isn't just about withholding personal health information. Given the fact that they are intimately involved, the boyfriend has a right to know about the circumstances that also affect him emotionally. Especially since he was worried and suspected she was pregnant. Furthermore, when the truth was eventually revealed, it caused distress and guilt in the boyfriend, which could have been avoided if a sincere conversation was initiated earlier. This lack of transparency erodes trust, which is fundamental to maintaining healthy relationships. Also, it deprived the boyfriend of a chance to provide emotional support during a challenging time, thus it's considered a breach of the ethical common sense related to truthfulness, respect and consideration for others in a relationship."

I write a lot in my free time.\n\nMy dad has been wanting me to \"publish\" a book for a long time now. I come from a family that's not rich per se but we live comfortably enough to afford a few things. My parents are parents, they're utterly obsessed with my writing and think it's godsend. I have a few national awards under my belt so I'm not a joke or anything but suffice it to say self publishing is pretty much a joke-- anyone can self publish anything if you have the $ to do it, I'm pretty sure amateur furry fanfics have been hardbound on Amazon, but my parents think a self-published book will make a good feature for my resume or something. At my age it would be very difficult for me to get published by a major publishing house, even if  am indeed a good author for my age-- I still have a lot of growing and refining to do to get to a professional level of authorship.\n\nFor a yearish my dad has been pressuring me to \"write a novel\" and I REALLY don't want to. Partially I've fallen out of the habit of writing since I've been busy with school and other activities, but also I don't want to self publish something I'll be embarrassed by later. For context when I was 13 my parents self published stuff I had written when I was 10-11... complete with embarrassing illustrations, and now people ask about it all the time. I hate it. I don't want something like that to happen again with this book, 8 years from now, when I am trying to get my foot in the door at a major publishing house or at a normal job or whatever.\n\nSo my dad has been pressuring me to write this, and I know if I didn't write it there would be consequences, so I just compiled a bunch of short stories I wrote for school and stuff and gave him that, around 60ish pages of work, just to shut him up for a while.\n\nIt's only now that he's starting to read through it and I realized I put some stuff in there that I would not want to be put out there-- content that is triggering for me, that's inspired by eating disorders I had that I kept hidden from my parents, etc. And that I don't want to tell my parents about anyway. So my dad is asking me about this story and I say, sorry I don't want that one to be in the book, I'm deleting it. Then he says no, it's good, keep it in... goes on like this back and forth for like 5 min. I get pretty adamant and admittedly lose my temper pretty majorly because this is pretty sensitive content to me (my dad doesn't know why though) and call him a psychopath. Then he calls me a rotten misbehaving spoilt brat and an asshole, tells me I am a child and to \"get in line and know your place\", that I better \"shape the fuck up for college\", and says just because I wrote 10 pages doesn't mean I get to choose what happen to them, and that I gave him this manuscript a year ago and said it was \"finished\" so why am I throwing a fit now, etc. He has some good points, and I know I shouldn't have lost my temper, but Istill feel that it is ultimately my work and I should be able to choose what happens to it, even if he is my dad.\n\nWho is in the wrong here?

Negligence of discomfort: The idea of walking for approximately 20-25 minutes in hot weather can cause discomfort or even dehydration hazards. Neglecting this factor in favor of saving a small amount of money appears insensitive and potentially harmful. \n\n4.

I was there in my capacity as a mystery shopper: think of me like an undercover hotel critic that produces an internal review for the hotel owners: I wasn't leaving a nasty yelp review.\n\nI was reviewing an upscale \"boutique\" hotel in the Hamptons, where the rooms were costing me $500 a night (not that I was paying out of pocket, but that shows you the clientele whose mindset I was trying to put myself into). The hotel was in a converted summer camp with bungalows and a \"rustic\" theme. One thing that was advertised on their website was that every room came with a grill for barbecuing. So when I came to check in, I brought some meat with me to BBQ since I hadn't done so in a while.\n\nTo my surprise, while the grills were advertised online, there was no charcoal or fuel. When I went to the front desk to ask for some, the woman running the front desk seemed surprised, and then recommended me a store nearby where I could buy some. I mentioned that it was a long walk away, and she offered to let me rent a bike free of charge to go there.\n\nI've reviewed plenty of luxury hotels in this job, and for $500 a night I would expect them to stock charcoal so I could grill if it's advertised on the website. And if they *didn't*, they should have sent someone to a store or supplier to go get me some, without my asking. I did notice that there only seemed to be one bellman or porter for the entire hotel, and very little staff overall. To be clear: I am perfectly capable of riding a bike to the store and buying charcoal, but while I was *mildly* miffed that it wasn't available or provided to me for free (or as part of a resort fee) I would imagine the target clientele might be *more* pissed.\n\nIn my internal review, I was asked if the staff fulfilled my needs and I said no. I later polled a few other people in my industry, and people seemed split down the middle about whether it was reasonable to expect charcoal be provided, that if it wasn't provided someone should've gone to the store *for* me, and if whether or not suggesting a store and offering a bicycle for me to buy my own charcoal \"fulfilled my needs.\"\n\nI argued that if I were paying Ritz prices in the Hamptons I should've been given free charcoal or, at the very least, offered something like a free meal in the hotel restaurant because I couldn't cook my own food.\n        ",

The critique given does not seem to be out of personal spite or with ill intentions but is based on his professional obligation to evaluate the hotel against their advertised amenities and services. Leaving an internal review is a standard procedure, and in this context, is acceptable as it helps the management to improve the guest experience. Despite the luxury expectancy, there was no entitlement or unreasonable demands coming from the reviewer; he only expected the service that was promised and thus, his actions are within ethical realm as per human commonsense."

The parents acted deceitfully by not telling their son the reality about the money he was handing over to them. Even though their motive was for the son's future benefit, they did not give him the chance to make an informed decision about his own finances. This undermines his autonomy as an independent adult and has led to feelings of resentment. The parents' intentions may have been good, but their method of accomplishing it was deceptive and didn't respect their son's autonomy, which is ethically wrong according to human commonsense."

From a commonsense ethics perspective, tasks such as cleaning up after meals are shared responsibilities in a household, especially if both partners are busy with work and other activities. Interestingly, the person who discovered the food left out is also responsible for securing it. The individual is also making assumptions about the girlfriend's action, which can lead to misunderstandings and potential resentment within the relationship. A responsible and ethical approach would involve discussing the issue openly and finding a solution that is agreeable to both parties, preventing wasted food and negative feelings from accumulating. It's important to be considerate and to remember that everyone has off days. Assuming responsibility, even in minor household tasks, shows respect and care for one another.

It also shows a sense of collective responsibility in ensuring every colleague's safety, which is a valuable ethical quality in a work environment. Besides, since they have also attempted to contact his wife multiple times to no avail, it indicates their respect for family hierarchy in such matters. Moreover, they had only considered reporting him missing after he repeatedly failed to turn up or respond, suggesting their decision isn't rash but cautiously considered. The update that Mark is fine, emphasizes that their worry was not baseless.

When I came back my mom (out so I thought) had painted my room bubble gum pink with hot pink trim and my sister's (age 5) room peach with dark peach trim. I hated my room. I was never a girly girl and I've always haired the color pink. Tbh this paint job probably was a huge reason for me going goth a few years later. My mom claimed she did because she \"knew\" I'd love or when I was a teenager and I needed to grow up. There was a huge fight and I had to live with that hell room until my parents renovated the house when I was 16. From the way my mom always talked about the room it was my punishment for not being a girly girl and not choosing what she wanted. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago I (now 38)was talking to my mom when that paint job came up. I kinda laughed out off and said something about how her plans didn't turn out the way she'd hoped.\n\nShe ended up telling me that it was actually my step dad who painted the room. She had gone out for the weekend while I was away and he thought he was doing something nice and painted our rooms to surprise her. She had never had any imput in the colours or that the rooms were being painted at all. She knew we would both hate the paint job but made us pretend to love them (clearly didn't work with me) because he did something nice and she would not have been able to afford to paint the rooms on her own. When we hated them, she just took the blame and made up excuses. \n\nI was floored learning this. When the painting had happened my mom and stepdad would have only have been dating for a few months and wouldn't start living together for another 3 years. I told my mom that if a partner I had ever did that it would be a huge red flag flag if not a complete deal breaker for me. I would be so pissed off if a person I had only known for less than a year decided he could take that much control over my house and my daughters lives. She got very quite and told me I really hurt her and she had to go. She sent me a text today saying how hurt she is that I would say something like that and that my stepdad had always been good to me. \n\nIt got me thinking about all the times my stepdad had done things that we just had to take because he's \"the man of the house\", even if he didn't ask for input from anyone. And how it had now bleed into my adult life. My stepdad is a great guy and we did have advantages in our lives that we probably would not have of he hadn't been in it. But that over step would have been too much for me in the first few months of dating. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mom that would have been a red flag/ deal breaker for me?\n\n**Edit** people seem to think that the colour is the deal breaker. It's not, as it said in the post my mom framed it that she had picked out the colour to punish me for not being girly. That's why we were taking about it - my son is now 11 and I am thinking about painting his room.\n\nTo me the red flag is that if someone I had only been dating for less that a year and only met my kids a handful of times came into my house while I was away and changed something about it without me knowing and without my input I would not be happy about it even if I was perfect.  That's what I had said to my mom.\n\n**edit 2** this post has actually brought up a lot of stuff I am going to have to work through. I am starting to realize how much my mom covered for my step dad. When I said he was a great guy in my post it's because I've pretty much been trained to never say anything bad about him. My childhood was not the perfect life some people have assumed.

I work 40 hours a week and she just stays home all day. It couldn\u2019t hurt her to throw something together or throw something in the oven, so I have something to eat when I get home and aren\u2019t forced to just snack on their leftovers or just eat canned soup everyday for Christ\u2019s sake.\n\nShe seemed surprised at first when I asked her and gave my reasons, then got moody about it. She kept giving excuses like she only cooks for her mom because she eats around the same time she gets home. I told her the easy solution to that would be to also eat around the time I get home. People eat more than one meal a day. When I was living at my sister\u2019s (30F) house before moving here, she would work 40 hours a week AND cook for us, so I told her since she isn\u2019t even making money and contributing to the household, the least she could do is cook as part of her chores.\n\nA little more about the chore, I do my fair share. We had sat down when she moved back in and divided chores up in between the four of us, so it would be even. Since she willingly offered to take on most of the kitchen for her chores, I had figured that it would include cooking.

Imposing upon her an additional task based on her available time and your convenience negates her autonomy and overlooks her effort already in place to contribute. Plus, pushing her to adhere to your food schedule without considering hers might unduly stress her out, further straining your relationship. Your comparison of her with your sister, who has different circumstances, also seems unfair, adding psychological pressure. Finally, the issue that she offers to cook with her brother while not extending the same courtesy to you might be a relational problem instead of one about chores.

I told her about my cat, a rescue with some anxious tendencies, and she said she had been thinking about adopting a dog. I said, verbatim, \u201cokay, that\u2019s something I\u2019d consider and you can look into, but we need to discuss what type of dog might be able to get along with my cat\u201d. She said \u201cdefinitely! Nothing is concrete yet.\u201d So I signed the year-long lease. \n\nFast forward a month, I see her posting on Facebook about her newly adopted puppy, also a rescue. It was the first I had heard about it, and I was shocked, but didn\u2019t know what to say. I just hoped that when I moved in that the dog would be cat friendly.\n\nA couple weeks later, I moved in with my cat and the dog is adorable as can be but very high energy. She would claw up my legs whenever it sees me, and bark/lunge at my cat whenever she saw her. I set up a puppy gate outside my room and naturally my cat stayed in there, only daring to venture outside when the dog was out of the apartment entirely. I again hoped that maybe it was just an adjustment period and in a couple months with some training things would settle down. \n\nA couple months pass and the dog is now approaching 50 pounds, has been in puppy training classes, but things aren\u2019t any better. Additionally, my roommate, a busy grad student with time to only walk her 2-3 times a day for 10 min, lets her pee and poop on our apartment floor, only taking time to clean it maybe once every 2 days. She still acts the same towards my cat and my cat is noticeably depressed, hardly eating and hiding all the time. I decide I need to move, and settle on subletting my room. \n\nI expected my roommate wouldn\u2019t really care that I\u2019m moving out, since I offered to pay rent until she can find a new roommate. To my surprise, she 1. Says she doesn\u2019t want me to move 2. Refuses to search herself, making me search for her new roommate then shooting down almost every person I suggest. \n\nAt this point I\u2019ve been moved out almost a month (and paid double rent this whole time), and we\u2019re close to settling on a new roommate, but she\u2019s still hostile. Someone contacted her wanting to move in, but not until January, and I offered to split December rent if she would prefer that person, which I thought was a generous offer, and she sent me a text explaining that I had fucked her over, that she had paid 2 months rent waiting for me to move in (100% her decision), and that she refused to pay any more. \n\nI am now in a new house where I am so much happier (and not stepping in dog poop on the daily), but I just wanted to know, am I the asshole here???\n\nTl;dr: roommate adopts puppy despite me saying that my cat may not get along with most dogs, dog terrorizes my cat, I move out and terminate the lease, AITA?\n\nUpdate: I talked to the landlord, and I am breaking the lease, paying rent for 30 days starting now, and getting my security deposit back.

The person took proper steps in considering his cat's wellbeing, given its anxious tendencies. On realizing that the living situation was negatively impacting his cat's mental and physical health, even after giving it a couple of months for adjustment, he made a decision to protect his pet. In addition, given the roommate's neglect in maintaining the cleanliness of the common space and the unease the dog caused the cat, the person had a right to move out. Offering to cover the rent until a new tenant is found is also seen as a responsible act. Lastly, he addressed this issue to the landlord as well, ultimately prioritizing overall wellness over a contractual obligation."

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for telling the hosts of our D&D game that their baby is an issue? | I've been a part if a grop of adults that get together to play DND every week for about 3 years now. We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\nEdit: I am not a part of the game night where the issue was brought up so I can't be sure exactly what was said. Also, I am female. I told her yesterday that I feel like shit about the situation because I loved having her join the game. The baby was putting more stress on everyone including the parents than it would have in an every day situation. My financial situation hasn't been the best in the past but I have a much better job now, I'm going to try to get the group to pay for a sitter because both parents deserve some time to relax. I always try to bring snacks to share as well, in the past ive just brought something like a bag of chips because again, my financial situation was not the best. \n\nI don't think that hosting elsewhere would be a good solution. That would still feel like we're kicking her out of the game deliberately which we are not trying to do. I realize now how it came across to bring up the issue especially because she just joined. \n\nTo everyone calling me an asshole, don't worry, I 100% feel like one even as I wrote the original post. This is something that we will have to work to solve as a group, starting with a group apology and clarification. \n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Lack of Empathy and Tact: The way the D&D group handled the situation by raising a complaint rather than suggesting a solution exhibits a lack of empathy. While the baby's disturbance can create far from an ideal gaming environment, informing parents without offering to help misrepresents the group\u2019s intentions, leading to understandable upset.\n\n2. Exclusion From Recreation: Rather than finding a way to accommodate the couple with the baby, they were effectively excluded from a recreational activity they enjoyed together. This can be seen as overly harsh, discouraging, and unsupportive from a community they were a part of.\n\n3. Absence of Constructive Solution: Rather than discussing a potential solution such as pooling resources to pay for a babysitter or rotating the gaming location, the group concentrated on the problems, this can be considered a lack of team spirit and negates the good that recreational activities such as D&D can provide.\n\n4. Lack of Understanding: The group displayed a lack of understanding towards the drastic life change that the couple underwent. Having a baby brings about many unforeseen challenges and friends are supposed to offer support during this period rather than additional stress.\n\nHad these reasons been considered, a different, more ethical resolution could have been reached that would have been inclusive, supportive, and considerate."

My idea involved eCommerce, dropshipping and a SEO service. So what do you do when you\u2019re 17 and want to do online business? You make the business under one of your parent\u2019s names. I chose my dad, since he offered it to me, and he didn\u2019t want any cut or anything (my mom didn\u2019t either, but my father was the one who offered me to sign up with his name). This means, that the money goes to his bank account, but then he sent the money to mine afterwards, since I needed to order the products for my buyers with money.\n\nUnlike the other ideas, dropshipping is relevant to this story. If you don\u2019t know what dropshipping is, then it\u2019s basically where you order products for others online, but you find a supplier that sells them for cheaper than the normal marketprice, so you can profit from it.

I wondered why, but after talking with my mom, I found out that my dad was in a little under $100,000 debt, and when you have this much debt in my country, you cannot earn anymore than what your regular job gives you - the state takes the rest.\nThis is because the state gives him economic support, so if he ever made $20,000 more than usual, then they should go to paying his debt and not on a car or similar.\n\nMy dad had offered to have his name on my business to pay off his debt without telling me.\n\nI was furious. Less because of the money I\u2019ve lost, but mostly because of the respect and trust I\u2019ve now completely lost for my dad.\n\nI haven\u2019t talked to him since.\n\nAITA for cutting him completely off without notice?\n\nI\u2019ll answer any questions in the comments.\n\n\nEDIT: Since many has asked:\n\nSince it was going very good, I was also very busy. In Denmark, you have a free pass for a specific amount depending on your age. That means you won\u2019t have to pay taxes on the first thousands(amount varies). The business wasn\u2019t a company, I was just registered on eBay, had my own Shopify and I was becoming very established on Amazon as well. I didn\u2019t think about changing the name just yet, since it was going great, so why should I? My plan was to take it over whenever my dad asked or something. The reason as to why I didn\u2019t notice before $40,000 racked up, was because he sent me money for the business, but nothing more. All earnings \u201cwent into my savings account\u201d.\n        ",

We went to college together, I introduced him to his wife - we'll call her Eve, and I was Best Man at their wedding.\n\nThey had been married for two years and no mention of even trying for a baby. Unbeknownst to me, they had been struggling to get pregnant from pretty much when they got married. They had been to doctors and everything and basically they found out that the problem is with Adam but decided to keep trying \"naturally\" for a few more years because they're still young and IVF is really expensive.\n\nAnyway I found all of this out about two months ago when Eve and I went away together for a work conference (we work in the same field and occasionally attend the same trainings/events etc). One night we got really smashed at the hotel bar and she basically burst out crying that she just wants a baby and she's afraid that it's never going to happen.\n\nOne thing led to another and after a lot more drinks we went up to my hotel room together. I feel sick even thinking about it - Adam is my best friend and I never meant to do anything like this. Eve was really upset about it too, and we both agreed to pretend it didn't happen and never mention it again.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, and Adam calls me absolutely over the moon. Eve is pregnant. He asked me out for some drinks so I go but the whole time there's this horrible nagging guilt.\n\nAdam tells me about all the difficulty that they've been having conceiving and that he thought he was basically infertile. He's calling it his \"miracle baby\" and I've never seen him so happy about anything.\n\nI don't know if I should tell him that the baby might not be his. They haven't had the first scan yet so they're not 100% sure about the dates, but I called Eve and spoke to her afterwards and she's pretty sure she's about 2 months along.\n\nI don't know what to do. To clarify - I don't want anything to do with the baby even if it is mine. The thing with Eve was a mistake. This isn't about money or anything either because Eve makes more than both Adam and me anyway. I just don't know if I could break my best friend's heart - I feel like I would be destroying his whole life - like if I tell him, he will lose his best friend, wife and baby.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I just don't tell him that the baby probably isn't his?\n\n**Also - I know that what I did was awful. I'm not asking about that. I already feel so terrible about it. I want to know whether I should tell him that the baby's not his when he is so happy.**\n\n**Update 1:** I know I'm the biggest asshole in the world for what happened. I spoke to Eve this morning on the phone and we're coming up with a plan. She has the scan next week to determine how far along she is. If the dates don't align with the work conference then we're both going to just thank our lucky stars and be incredibly happy for this \"miracle baby\". If, however, it looks like it could be mine based on the dates, then we're undecided. Based on the pretty unanimous feedback here I guess we should come clean to Adam, but at the same time I'm still pretty torn up about destroying his - and the unborn baby's - lives. I appreciate that things always come out in the wash, but I don't know if maybe everyone would be happier if the story is just that this great and loving couple finally had their miracle baby.\n\nEither way, I'm looking at quitting my job and moving to put a bit of distance between us all.\n        ",

Neglecting to share newborn caregiving duties, especially during the night, reveals a lack of empathy towards the partner\u2019s physical and emotional well-being. Hence, it is ethically unsound.

His position comes with benefits, including undergraduate tuition exemption for any kids under 26 and taxable tuition (explained below) for any kids in grad school.\n\n\nFianc\u00e9\u2019s parents divorced when he was young. Dad refused to pay child support for years which caused a lot of bitterness between him and mom. Mom did not hide her hatred, fianc\u00e9 grew up being told his dad didn\u2019t care about him \u2013 he has depression and a bad relationship with his mom, but when he got older and dad quit drinking, relationship with dad got better despite their past. \n\n\nFianc\u00e9 dropped out of college in \u201909 after his first semester and that\u2019s when we met and started dating. Next few years he went to community college near my college, we lived together (\u201811-\u201813) and his mom paid his rent, and after I graduated (\u201813) and moved back home he moved with me and lived with me at my mom\u2019s house rent-free (my mom is awesome and loves him like a son). We both worked for a few years (\u201814-\u201817) and in that time he decided he wanted to apply to finish his degree at his dad\u2019s school. He got in and bc he was still 26, paid no tuition for the next 2-3 years and finished his degree this past May. He got into a master\u2019s program (with a small scholarship) at the same school but now has to pay some tuition.\n\n\nEach year he has taken out a small loan ($8-10K) to help with living expenses, books etc. I am not working anymore (back in school) but with savings from my job and a substantial inheritance from my father, I keep us comfortable, pay rent and most bills, which I am fine with. However, I cannot afford to help my fianc\u00e9 with tuition (nor would I be allowed to since my inheritance is in a trust and heavily regulated).\n\n\nTaxable tuition 101: the tuition that would normally be paid is added onto the professor\u2019s income. If dad makes $100K/year and tuition is $20K, his income is considered $120K and he is taxed based on that amount. So if income tax is 30% of annual income, he pays $36K in taxes instead of $30K. This results in a loss of $6K for that year (none of these numbers are exact but also not too far off from the real numbers).\n\n\nDad does not want to lose this income and wants fianc\u00e9 to pay him back. My feeling is that he never paid child support, tuition, or living expenses for his son growing up (despite having the means), and this is a small price to pay for his neglect. Fianc\u00e9 told dad he can\u2019t afford to pay him back so dad said fine, he\u2019ll pay, and his girlfriend even offered to pay half. Recently they spoke again and dad reneged, he still wants money from fianc\u00e9 for tuition. This money would come out of the loan money he receives for living expenses which he already has to pay back. We think dad is being selfish and unreasonable. What do you think?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all your responses. In retrospect a more accurate query would have been \u201cAITA for suggesting/feeling like it would be the right thing for my fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad to not make my fianc\u00e9 pay him back for income lost due to taxable tuition?\u201d, mainly because some of the finer points were missed and my actual part in his conversation with his dad was misinterpreted due to my poor phrasing (I was not part of their conversation at all and merely offered my fianc\u00e9 my opinion), but I accept your judgment regardless and thank all of you for your time and thoughts.\n        ",

In addition, the father's decision to renege on his agreement to cover the taxable tuition greatly affects the financial wellbeing of his son. It's also important to consider the emotional impact this may have on the son, who already has a strained relationship with his father. Despite the recovering relationship, this situation worsens their connection and contributes to an unjust and morally undesirable circumstance.

Then this morning I pull up to McDonald's, get a couple items, totalling to $5.01. I pull up to the window and give the lady my cool $20 bill and one penny, she holds it up to the light which I understood as it looks weird and I figured she's making sure it's legit. She puts it under the cash drawer, gives me my change back, I get my food and leave in a hurry (I was late to work.) \n\nAs I'm driving trying to put the cash in my wallet I notice she gave me 2 $20 bills and a $5 bill. For a moment I was incredibly confused wondering if I just took money out of my wallet some how, I check the receipt and low and behold it says I paid with a $50. Now I was seriously about to turn around and go give the money back thinking this worker is probably freaking out realizing she just gave me $25 more than I was supposed to. But after some thinking I realized \n\n1. This girl probably didn't even notice as she put the the bill under the tray \n2. She probably won't get in trouble as I have worked in the food industry and they'll see she tendered a $50 and there's only a $20 under the drawer, most she'll get is a stern talking-to because mistakes happen and she clearly wasn't stealing the money \n3. McDonald's is a multi-million dollar company, this is a McDonald's I go to all the time and they have probably made hundreds of dollars off me alone, so what if I get $25 back.\n\nSo if I don't go back later today WIBTA?\n\nEDIT: To the people saying this could be the one mistake that breaks it for her and leads to her getting fired, wouldn't me showing up and giving the money back not draw attention to the transaction that she messed up on? Would she not get in trouble whether I bring it back or not?  I feel not giving it back keeps the blame off one person, if I bring it back they know exactly who messed up. They're not going to let her off just because I brought it back, if she messed up she messed up.\n\nEDIT2: I appreciate all the feedback and the many points I didn't take into account, I'll let you know what the verdict is when I get off work.\n\nEDIT3: Even though my coworkers agree that there's no harm in keeping it, I've decided to take it back on my lunch break to try and get there while the cashier is still there. Y'all are ruthless but I appreciate it the feedback and the many points I didn't think of. I'll let you know how it goes.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Well instead of going to return it on my lunch break, I instead had to call the bank for a charge that was disputed yesterday and after they agreed I shouldn't have received it, it was posted to my account today. I called and they said they couldn't refund more than one false charge a year. WTF?! So yeah I didn't get to return it because of the stupid bank, and I'm not going to. This lady probably didn't get in trouble and if she did for this happening multiple times, maybe she shouldn't be a cashier if she can't count money.  And to those saying \"but good karma!\" Well I just got fucked out of over $30 so I'll take that as karma paying me back.\n        ",

Honesty: Upon realizing that they received more change than they were due, it's reasonable to expect an honest individual to return the excess amount.\n2. Responsibility: The individual involved felt they had justified reasons to keep the excess change, choosing personal gain over responsibility for the consequences, which likely falls upon the cashier who made the mistake.\n3. Impact: Although the individual argues that McDonald's is a multi-million dollar company that won't be impacted by this, the minimum wage employee who made the error could face repercussions, possibly losing their job.\n4. Intent: The individual decided to not return the money even after considering the consequences, demonstrating an intention to profit from another person's mistake, which is considered unethical.\n5. Rectification: The individual assumed that returning the money would result in the cashier being blamed, which he deemed as a reason not to return. However, in general, we are ethically bound to rectify an error when realized, the repercussions of actions are to be faced by the person who made the error. In this case, the cashier. \n\nThe ethical judgment holds that keeping money that one knows does not rightly belong to them is inappropriate, regardless of the situation or justifications made."

The difference between us is that while I do enjoy being at home, I still love to travel and experience new things. My boyfriend doesn\u2019t see the point as much and prefers to do things inexpensive and not far from home.\n\nI\u2019ve been planning a trip to Europe with two of our close friends for the past couple months and we were planning to go for 20 days (Portugal, Spain, France, Netherlands). My boyfriend has been hesitant about it since the start due to him not liking travel as much, but I was confident I could convince him. I usually take on the role of planner for our group so he wouldn\u2019t really have to do anything except come along for the ride.\n\nToday I find out that ok he agrees to come but he will only come for two weeks. He says he doesn\u2019t like being out of his normal routine for very long. I was upset by this because for me (someone who likes to travel), this seems like the most amazing trip and we would have such an awesome time with our two close friends. Another reason I was upset is because our other two friends going are a couple and I don\u2019t want to have to spend a week (Portugal and Spain) being a third wheel. \n\nI am already spending an extra two weeks in Madrid solo traveling before our group trip starts and I just really want my boyfriend to come for the full 3 weeks. I have even offered to pay his portion for the extra week so we could enjoy that time together but he said that would be worse than him just not going the third week at all. In my mind, if he\u2019s already agreeing to 14 days, what\u2019s so bad about staying an extra 6 especially when I\u2019ve said how important the trip is to me (I\u2019ve been wanting to go to Europe for the past 4 years and finally have enough money) and offering to pay.\n\nAITA for being upset by this? I\u2019m trying to see his side but I feel like this would be such a fun experience and I want to do it with him in its entirety.\n\nUPDATE: Seems I\u2019m the asshole.

Your boyfriend has made it clear that he prefers not to travel extensively and he's uncomfortable being out of his routine for long. Despite this, you are attempting to coerce him into joining for the full trip, dismissing his feelings and preferences.\n\nSecondly, it also involves a degree of emotional manipulation since you express being upset about the possibility of being a \"third wheel\", putting additional emotional pressure on him to comply with your wishes. This is not fair or respectful to his feelings, which is crucial in a healthy relationship.\n\nLastly, the offer to pay for his final week could be seen as trying to buy his compliance rather than respecting his feelings or wishes. While it seems like a generous offer, if it's against his will, it is fundamentally disrespectful. Therefore, the scenario is ethically unacceptable according to human commonsense."

I was already an adult in my own home and married with a child on the way when my dad married her and she moved in. I had two siblings still living in their home. My brother was 13 and sister 14.\n\n They wanted money for extra things so they were allowed to get jobs to pay for those extras. Being underage they did odd jobs as most kids that age. My siblings were very attached to me as I mostly raised them, and then when my son was born you couldn't keep them away!  So they often stayed the weekends with me. Just siblings hanging out. Occasionally I would need them to babysit so if they were there for that purpose they were paid.\n\n They got in trouble here and there for things and were grounded. If they were grounded they didn't get to come hang out and stay the night with me. I totally get that and agreed completely. They were staying to have fun. No fun for them they are grounded.  Now onto the main event. \n\nMy husband and I had an important thing we could not cancel and scheduled ahead for my sister to babysit on a sat. My sister had got in trouble and was grounded. I get that 100%. But this was a babysitting job. Not fun. We knew she was grounded but didn't make other arrangements, because this was never something that occured to any of us. \n\nMy step mother informed us that Friday night my sister couldn't babysit for us sat. Because she was In trouble and grounded. No one was consulted about it. Just told. So I went over to talk to them to figure out what was going on and why she couldn't still do her \"job\" and babysit for us. They had been grounded before for things but were never made to cancel their jobs. Infact my brother was grounded but was still allowed to do the lawn mowing job he had set up. But my sister couldn't babysit for us, even though that was her job.  The reasoning was because she goes to my house to have fun.  I addressed with her that I realize that and that's why they don't get to stay the night when they are grounded or come over to hangout or anything of that nature. It just happens that her job and her fun are the same place.  If she had a job lined up to watch someone else's kids would they ground her from that? It's a scheduled responsibility that would screw people over especially last minute. Like it was doing to us.  AITA for insisting that this was my sister's job and unfair to us that it be canceled in this manor? I can see clearly that this is a job but my step mother couldn't.\n\n\nEdit: my dad ended up watching my son. It was something we couldn't get out of. I didn't want to cause them to argue so just asked my dad to do it.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The main issue here is the perception of punishment and work. The sibling, despite being grounded, had committed to a responsibility - a job in this case, i.e., babysitting. Disciplining children might involve restricting privileges, but shouldn\u2019t interfere with one's responsibilities or job. Similarly as the brother was allowed to do his job while grounded, it is commonsense that the sister should have been allowed to meet her commitment too. In addition, cancelling the job last minute puts unnecessary strain on others, depicted by the struggle the protagonist faced due to this decision. Therefore, insisting that the sister should be able to carry out her duty despite being grounded is ethically justifiable by human commonsense."

It's held on the same weekend every year, and MIL expects all of her kids to come (it's basically 2nd Christmas at this point). It has only changed weekends a couple of times in the last 2 decades, causing chaos, sooo they don't change it idly. Also of important note, MIL organises and purchases everything, then divides the cost by person and each family reimburses her for their portion. No one has a problem doing this, including us. \n\nI love this trip. I look forward to it every year, because it's often the only vacation hubby and I get. This year however, the camping trip weekend falls 6wks after my due date. \n\nI made an idle comment to MIL a couple weeks before Christmas about us planning on coming, and massively looking forward to it, while simultaneously hoping that I'll feel up to us coming...basically a hope and plan for the best but mentally prepare for the worst type conversation.\n\nShe became visibly irate, and asked WHY I thought we might not come.\n\n....b-because I will have very recently pushed a squashed watermelon out of my baby purse (or if I'm unlucky had my abdomen carved open, rifled through, then slapped back together like a Thanksgiving turkey) and I physically might be in extreme discomfort or pain, rendering the idea of being in an unpredictable, \"rustic\" environment with shared (and probably less-than-sanitary) facilities entirely unappealing?\n\nShe made a face and didn't say anything else about it, but a couple weeks later at Christmas, hubby and I's Christmas gift was a homemade gift certificate explaining that our family's camping expenses were prepaid in full. \n\nI mentioned to hubby that I was SUPER APPRECIATIVE of this gesture, but that I simultaneously feel that she's manipulating me into a position of not being able to say \"no\" to coming on the camping trip, which I dislike. He was irritated with me for seeing ulterior motives in his mom's generosity.\n\nTL;DR - I tell MIL we *might* not be coming on a traditional yearly camping trip due to my having given birth just weeks prior, she responds by paying for our portion of expenses...I feel she's manipulating me/us into coming, hubby feels I'm being ungrateful and petty.

Though it can be perceived as manipulative, it can also be construed as an act of goodwill. Ultimately, the final decision on whether you attend the camping trip lies with you, considering your health and comfort after delivery is a priority. Hence, the scenario becomes ethically acceptable as your autonomy in making that decision is not infringed upon. Your husband's irritation might stem from a defensive standpoint concerning his mother's actions, which is also understandable.

Pizza was provided and it was the basic \u201cthere are four kids in the house, make sure they don\u2019t die on anything\u201d regime.  Typically if this sitter watches all four of my biological kids at my house, we pay her 10 bucks an hour (our kids are low drama, and the sitter in question seems cool with this arrangement).\n\nTonight, since we had a mix of our kids and the other couples kids (but mind you, the same number of kids, total) my wife flipped out because I suggested we split the total, because \u201cwe always pay 10 dollars an hour to watch our kids.\u201d  Now mind you, she was still going to get that, between the two couples (likely plus some).  This led to a marriage ending (not really) argument about whether a sitter should get more money based on the \"genus\" of the kids they were watching.   Considering there wad a graphic design professional in the back seat at the time that admitted she made less than 20 bucks an hour, the idea of doubling down and paying this sitter 20 dollars an hour (10 for their kids, 10 for mine) seemed ludicrous.\n\nAm I the asshole?  i just thing 20 bucks an hour (in a non-professional) environment to play candy crush and occasionally yell \"is everyone okay?\" seems like a lot...\n\nEDIT:  Wow...  Getting lot of hate on the pay rate here...  To clarify, we live in the Midwest (Kansas) and cost of living (and therefore, salaries) are way lower here.  For context, my wife is a children\u2019s director at an institute here and is only paid 12 dollars an hour here (minimum wage is 7.25).  I know 10 dollar an hour may seem low, but keep in mind that in Kansas a 4 bedroom / 2 Bath is less than 120k.\n\nEDIT 2:  The couple in question are our best friends and frequently use the same sitter.  Our kids are also very frequently around each other and have used the same sitter (often at the same time).  This is just a frequent argument we get into as to whether 2 families equals 2 times the pay.  There are not many jobs where you can do two things at once (think any trade skill) and that is my typical argument.  Folks are not just paid for skill, but the time spent using said skill.\n\nEDIT 3:  i must have been on the wrong time zones for this post.  A few clarifying facts...  1) I live in Midwest America, and the minimum wage here is 7.25.  2) This is NOT a professional nanny but a family friend, and 3) this mix of kids is from two couples who are all best friends that use this same sitter all the time.  (Plus, by dinner everything we hire her).\n\nEDIT 4:  Haha!  So reading this post now this morning.  Last night was an open bar event, and I was fuming from arguing with my wife.  We did pay the sitter approx. 18 bucks an hour total.  I should have made that clear.  I appreciate all the comments, and I probably could have laid off on the \u201cplaying candy crush\u201d comments.  I do respect people that watch kids but was not in a good mindset when making the post.  I will take all this feedback into account going forward!\n        ",

The sitter was watching kids from two different families, which could potentially increase the complexity and workload, even if the total number of kids remained the same.\n3. The suggested idea of splitting the pay, whilst logically sounding fair because each family pays for their kids, essentially lowers the sitter's earnings for the same amount of work and responsibility. \n4. Failing to acknowledge the potential complexities of the job and suggesting lower payment exhibits a lack of empathy and respect towards the sitter's work.\n5. The comments about the sitter \"playing candy crush\", undermines the scope and importance of the sitter\u2019s work. This does not encourage a respectful professional relationship.\n6.

She was pissed and we got into a big argument which obviously ruined the end of the trip.\n\nMy husband thinks it\u2019s insane that she would ask me to pay her anything. However, a mutual friend of ours is on the side of the friend who had surgery. So I\u2019m starting to doubt myself. \n\nAm I somehow wrong to expect that she\u2019d cover the cost of the hotel under these circumstances? I mean, would you ask a friend to pay who spent time taking care of you?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. Even though it may seem controversial, human commonsense recognizes that implicit social contracts often exist between friends. In this case, there was no initial agreement for you to pay for the hotel suite while you helped take care of your friend after her surgery. You provided her a valuable service and your expected 'payment' was the free stay you received. This understanding is drawn from the commonsense understanding that one usually does not charge a friend who is doing them a solid. Therefore, your decision not to pay for the hotel suite after the fact is justified by human commonsense."

I have raised my eldest daughter on my own until my now partner (30M) came along. I have raised my two youngest with my partner.\n\nSo, my eldest daughter (17F) has expressed to me that she wants to move out of the house and in with her boyfriend (17M) of two years. \n\nShe sat down with me and told me how she is very unhappy at home, she doesn\u2019t want to listen to her younger siblings screaming, she has a bad mental state, blah blah blah. Those sorts of things.\n\nShe said she felt she is ready and that, in our country, she is of age to move out without permission from parents or guardians. I googled it and she is right about that but, I don\u2019t think she is ready in my personal opinion. \n\nShe argued that she can take care of herself, she has a job, she is financially stable, she\u2019s learning to drive, she can cook, she can clean. Whatever. \n\nBut, despite this, I don\u2019t feel she\u2019s ready to leave the nest yet. She\u2019s very forgetful and clumsy at times. She can\u2019t cook real food. She spills things and knocks things about. She misplaces things and loses things all of the time. Shes very quiet and won\u2019t talk to people and just sits in her room and acts depressed. She\u2019s just very clueless and dramatic and I don\u2019t want to send her out into the world like this. \n\nPlus, I don\u2019t think this is fair on her little siblings. They love her a lot and they would be really sad if she just up and left them. \n\nThat all being said, I love my daughter very much and I\u2019m only trying to do what is in her best interest. Her mental state is fine and she doesn\u2019t need to leave in my opinion. I\u2019m just convinced she\u2019s not ready to survive the world on her own. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t happy about my decision and she said that this wasn\u2019t my decision to make. She said that she was just simply telling me she will be moving out soon. \n\nOver the past few weeks I\u2019ve caught her sneaking bags of clothes to work with her to take to her boyfriend\u2019s place afterwards. I took them away from her and put them back in her room obviously. \n\nI was talking to my friend the other night about this and she seemed a bit shocked. She told me I was an arsehole and I was basically \u201cdisregarding my daughters feelings\u201d as she put it. I think that\u2019s really extreme and that\u2019s not her place to tell me how to parent. \n\nSo, am I the arsehole? I think I\u2019m within my right to be looking out for my daughter and keep her home until I feel she\u2019s ready.\n\n\nEdit - Okay, so I didn\u2019t expect so many to jump onto this. I\u2019m looking at all of the comments and I wasn\u2019t really expecting the arsehole judgement but oh well.\n\nSo, she works a full time job doing an internship or apprenticeship, I\u2019m not entirely sure which one. And, she attends college once a week. \n\nThe reason I won\u2019t take her mental health seriously is because she\u2019s not really diagnosed with anything. She doesn\u2019t have depression or anxiety or anything like that she just acts like she does. \n\nAs for her boyfriend, I\u2019ve met him many times and he seems very nice. Always taking her out, always hugging her, laughing together, he buys her gifts, he was there for her when she got bullied. They\u2019ve never had any huge arguments or fought or broken up. They were also best friends for a bit before they got together. Just a bit quiet but other than that, he seems alright for her in my books.\n\nEdit 2 - As I mentioned, I didn\u2019t expect so many people to comment on this. There are too many comments to reply to so I\u2019m going to read them and process them as I wasn\u2019t really expecting an arsehole judgement. Thanks for the judgements.\n\nEdit 3 - Correcting information about my partner.\n\nEdit 4 - Can some of you stop messaging me and telling me I should die or I need to kill myself? I\u2019m processing all of these comments at the moment and that\u2019s all I can do right now.\n        ",

From a commonsense perspective, we should respect autonomy and personal growth, particularly when the individual in question is legally considered an adult in their culture or society. The daughter has shown, through her job and responsibilities, an ability to self-manage.

Parents historically have a duty to prepare their children for adulthood, which implies accepting when they are making strides towards independence. The mother's actions in taking away her daughter\u2019s belongings and not taking her mental health seriously also raise ethical concerns as they might infringe on the daughter's personal rights and well-being.

She's a really good kid , so I rarely have to apologize for something she does or my bad parenting decisions. I often get compliments on how well behaved she is and her calm temperament, but make no mistake, she is still a toddler, so we have our moments.\n\nWe are at the checkout line and we are 2nd in line. They're two cashiers next to each other at a counter, so there is a lady in front of me (lady #1) and another lady in front of me (lady #2) , but off to the right a bit, maybe 2 feet away from us. My kid is acting up a little and trying to run off from me in the line, but no one has noticed us and no attention is being drawn. I grab her hand and she giggles a little loudly, as she thinks it's funny, then drops her toy she had in her hand. She gets down to retrieve it, but when she gets up she is very close to lady #2, and in that split second she thought she was me and hugs her legs from behind, her head landing between her legs, right under her butt.\n\nI quickly called out my daughter's name to help her realize,Whoa, that ain't mommy. The look on her face when she realized that she was hugging a stranger was priceless and a funny  honest mistake. I'm laughing and herding my daughter back over to me. this lady turns around and she is pissed. She was about 25 and she was giving my daughter a look as if she was a 40 year old slimeball who just grabbed her ass. \n\nI get not all people like kids and I respect that, but I thought she was going to hit my kid with the look she had on her face. She continued to stay turned staring at my daughter with a scowl of hatred. Now I'm already laughing, but I'm a nervous laugher on top it. So when I see this lady acting like she is about to unwind on my kid, the laughing just continues. The lady then glares at me and I cant help myself.. I keep laughing, but I glared right back. I said nothing. Normally I'm a pushover and very easy and quick to apologize for anything and everything, but the fact that she seemed so offended by a kid accidently hugging her, it almost wanted to make me see red. I hugged my daughter and then looked up at this woman who had the most ugly twisted face at this point and I just smiled and raised my eyebrows as to ask if there was a problem here.\n\nThis whole thing lasted maybe 15 seconds, but fuck that time lasted forever. Lady #1then turns around and is now just staring at me and my daughter as well, shaking her head a bit in disapproval. That gets me thinking, wow, did I just make a parenting fuck up that I should have apologized for instead of laughing at this woman and her reaction? So was I the asshole in all of this?\n\nNormally i would apologize at the drop of a hat, but the way this lady looked at my daughter with such hatred really just pissed me off badly. What do you guys think? Did mama bear mode get the best of me? I kinda fear I'm the asshole\n\n\nEdit: I'm the asshole. I could and should have easily diffused the situation with a quick apology for my daughter's accidental hug, but I just laughed in a way that could be taken very offensively. That's where I fucked up and should have shut up . To the random lady in the store, if your reading this, I'm sorry! My daughter thought you were me.\n\nIf you guys want to read about me and my many more fuck ups with my 6 other kids, look for me on Entitled Parents.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. From a human commonsense perspective, the mistake made by the toddler was innocent and not her fault. However, the mother's reaction, involving laughter without an immediate apology, can be viewed as rude and not in line with general societal norms. Despite the fact that the woman's reaction might have been exaggerated, commonsense dictates that the mother should have apologized for the unintentional inconvenience caused. This is because an unexplained act, especially involving physical contact can seemingly feel intrusive or uncomfortable to the person on the receiving end; an apology would serve as an acknowledgment of this discomfort. Handling the situation with understanding and an apology would've maintained respect and peace. Therefore, their failure to do so makes this scenario ethically unacceptable."

Their favorite insult for me since I was a small kid is \"tree-hugging liberal hippie\" and they adamantly don't believe that environmental science is a legitimate field.

They went absolutely nuts on me, saying that I should have informed them so that they could change my mind. There was also a lot of talk about how I have absolutely wasted my life (I'm 24 right now), that I'll never get a job, that I've turned into a nutjob, etc. I tried to reason with them that I had my reasons for hiding it, and that I had only just started the program. But everytime I've tried to talk to them since they refuse to respond to me, and my sister has told me that they keep complaining about it at home.\n\nAITA for not telling them about my program change?\n\n(If it matters, I am fully funding this program by myself.

Personal Autonomy: As an adult, one has the right to make decisions about their life including their education and career paths. In this case, the individual is fully funding their own education, which emphasizes their independence and autonomy.\n\n2. Informed Decision: The change wasn't made impulsively but based on the experiences and feelings of burnout in their previous program. Hence, the decision to switch was informed and thought-out.\n\n3. Communication Delay: The delay in informing the parents doesn't represent deceit, rather it was a measure taken to avoid unnecessary conflicts until the details were worked out, plans were solidified, and the individual had settled into the new program.\n\n4. Differing Values: While parents might disapprove due to their personal belief systems, it doesn't make the decision unethical. Differences in values and interpretations should be respected as long as the decisions aren't harming others or oneself.\n\nIn conclusion, this scenario aligns with the principles of personal autonomy, proactive decision-making, and respect for differing values and beliefs."

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for arguing with my bf's housemate about my ESA? | So I just started dating this guy, we really click, he's great, yadda yadda. He lives in a house with 3 other people, owned by one girl. It's a super nice house, and they're all good friends. At first I was a bit apprehensive because two of the housemates are girls, but I met them early and they seemed cool.\n\nUntil this past weekend, that is. The house threw a party, which I heard are always amazing. I was invited, and I wanted to bring my emotional support dog, Sadie, to the party with me. I have really bad anxiety sometimes and she helps a lot. Sadie is super well behaved and a medium sized dog, so I thought it would be no problem, plus people really love her especially at parties. She's a total ham. I even put her ESA harness on her. But when we got to the door, my boyfriend and housemate (the house owner) opened up and she looked a little pissed. She said Sadie can't come into the party, that it's not a good environment for a dog, and she wasn't given advance notice so that she could at least dogproof. But why would I give notice that I am bringing my support animal with me?\n\nSo I asked her what if I was blind or epileptic and needed a dog. She said if I was blind she would have been happy to make arrangements beforehand for me, and that if I was epileptic that party wouldn't be a good environment for me anyway, as there are strobes and loud music which also aren't great for dogs, totally missing the point. I kept arguing with her about the legally protected status of my dog, and she just kept saying it doesn't apply for private property. This kept going on for like 15 minutes and she got more and more annoyed, saying she's seen me a hundred times out without the dog, but it's a party which is duh, where I'm more likely to have anxiety so of course I wanted her there.\n\nAfter going back and forth she was basically like, \"look, the dog isn't coming into my house. That's final. You can put her in the backyard but that's it.\"\n\nWhile in the backyard, Sadie dug up some stuff because she's used to always being with me and I guess broke or chewed a chair. I'm fine with paying for those things if me and my bf stay together, but I kinda don't want to because if she'd just let my dog stay with me it wouldn't have even happened and because my bf didn't really take my side against his housemate and said it would be best if I don't bring Sadie over there again in the future as his housemate is really pissed.\n\nAITA for getting into it with her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For the people focused on me not wanting to pay, I said I didn't want to, not that I won't, but as I said in the comments:  The chewing in the backyard, I didn't even see, so I'm not even sure if it happened or if it was her and asked for pictures but still haven't seen any, and the flowers my bf sent me a picture, doesn't look like she dug them up, but instead was walking on them since they were right next to the backdoor and she wanted to get to me. I still get that I should have to pay if she messed up the flowers, that's not the point.\n\nALSO: My argument wasn't that she's legally allowed to be in the house, just that it's dickish to refuse because it's a support animal. It was more than my dog is an esa so does have some legal rights and isn't \"just a pet\". Even a service animal can't go into a private house, duh, everyone knows that. That's why I said she totally missed my point. But whoever that person is that says a service animal CAN'T is an asshole which is why I think she is the asshole.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable due to a lack of respectful consideration and appropriate communication. The person bringing the emotional support animal (ESA) to a party in a private household without pre-informing the house owner demonstrates a sense of entitlement and lack of respect for the owner's space and rules. Moreover, comparing an ESA to a service animal for a blind or epileptic individual disregards the specific function and trained roles of these service animals. Failing to supervise ESA dog in the backyard, leading to the destruction of property, further heightens the disregard for others' belongings. Regardless of the legal status of the ESA, respect for others' homes, possessions, and comfort should be ensured. Finally, her resistance to take responsibility for the damages the dog caused because of her own actions shows a lack of accountability."

They have known each other for about 7 years, dating for 2 years. I am friends with him as well.\n\nSaturday morning we woke up and my friends boyfriend and I wanted to go get breakfast at this all day pub right across the street from their apartment. Best friend did not want to go because she is trying to be healthy, and said she was going to go to the gym for an hour instead and would see us after. We said OK.\n\nWe had brought their dog with us and the pub let us know that they wouldn't let the dog on the patio. So my friends boyfriend and I decided to go get wraps somewhere else and drive about 40 minutes out to this beach to take the dog off leash and for a run. We took her car to do so because she lets the boyfriend use her car whenever he wants.\n\nI didn't think we were gone that long but didn't consider how long it would take to get wraps and drive to the area. We were gone for about 2 1/2 hours when my best friend texted us asking where we were. We told her.\n\nShe was, and still is, LIVID. The beach is quite beautiful so both of us had shared photos on our snapchats of the area and I guess she saw and was mad. we reminded her that she didn't want to come out with us and she said she thought we were going for breakfast across the street, not to some beach for hours and that she would've come if we had even thought to invited her. Apparently her and boyfriend had plans as well but he says that she had just suggested it as something to do and nothing was concrete and it was HER plans so figured she wouldn't want to come since she didn't want to come for breakfast. I apologized but mentioned I dont think I personally did anything wrong. The breakfast place didn't work out and when wraps and a walk with the dog was suggested instead I was happy to do so.\n\nBest friend is absolutely livid at us both. She says not only did we completely switch up what we said we were going to do, ditch her, we took her car to do so. Her boyfriend says she may break up with him over this. I tried to talk to her about this and she said while she is more mad at BF because they had made plans that he bailed on to go to the beach with me and took her car to do so, shes mad at me because she thinks I do this all the time where I steam roll her plans and get the guys shes interested in to choose me over her, which I think is ridiculous. I'm a flirty person I guess but I don't flirt with the guy shes seeing.\n\nI spoke about this with some of my other friends and some of them said shes overreacting, but others have said i was an asshole here.

This normally would be totally fine with me except in this circumstance these kids are riding im excess of the speed limit (20 mph), they appear to be young (im guessing 14 and 12 years old) or at least not old enough to have a license, the ATV isn't registered, they are riding around with headphones on, and they have absolutely no safety gear on (no helmet, no gloves, hell not even a reflective vest!).\n\nThis is extremely dangerous! And very neglectful of the parents to even let their children do something so reckless. ATVs, while they are fun, are not toys! They are motor vehicles capable of traveling in excess of 50 mph! I don't want to file a report to get them in trouble, I am just worried about their safety. All it takes is one spill to lose your life, I would hate to be in my garage working and hear the squeal of some tires or a loud crash and have to see someone poor child laid out on the road. \n\nNormally, I wouldn't get involved in other people's business, but this just feels so dangerous that I can't help but feel like I need to contact someone who could assert some authority and maybe prevent a terrible accident. \n\nIm actually going to call the police now because they are now driving by dangerously close to other children playing in the streets, taunting and showing their middle finger as they drive by. Am I the asshole? Or is my worry valid?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThe police were very receptive and quick to come drive through the neighborhood. I submitted an anonymous report and the officer was just as worried about their safety as I was. \n\nIm not sure if they ended up making contact with the kids but I did see the police cruiser drive past my house about 5-10 minutes later. About 30 seconds before the police went by the kids flew by on the ATV so they were a few seconds behind them. After I saw the police leave the neighborhood I noticed the kids pushing the ATV back to their house...so im assuming they spotted them and told them to push it home. Either way they haven't be on it since.\n\nI honestly feel relieved. Every time they flew by I felt worried they were going to get into a wreck. A friend of mine flew off the back of an ATV a few years ago as the driver turned into a driveway. She unfortunately passed away as a result. I couldn't help but to think what if they clip a mailbox, or turn the handlebars a little too sharply, or a car backs out into the road in front of them. It would have been bad. I know they are just some kids having fun.. but an ATV is quite the upgrade for the same two kids who, just last month, were falling off their 2 wheeled hoverboards going down the road 5 mph. \n        ",

The person called the police not with an intention to cause trouble, but to ensure the children's safety and maintain peace in the community. Furthermore, this action also seeks to protect other community members who could be affected by the children's hazardous actions.

It's going well, she's working hard to get more stable, and it feels like starting over again as a mother-I've always loved the baby stage best.\n\nSince this my biological daughter has become bitchy and unpleasant. When I asked what was wrong, she told me she thought it was \"fucked up\" that I opted out of parenting both my children, sort of blaming me for their mental health, and then I play mother of the year for a baby that isn't mine. I let it go because to an extent I see her point. I was a young, single, working mother, so I didn't spend much time with either of my children. I wasn't the most mature or best equipped to handle them like I am now. I figured she would get over it if I let her vent.\n\nShe didn't get any happier or nicer, so I asked again. And again. And she kept complaining about her *terrible* childhood and how awful I was. Eventually I got sick of it and told her the reality-she was a problem child and I was in over my head trying to do my best. I had to handle her underage drinking, drug use, frequent arrests, and an expulsion and she never made it easy. She said that she hoped her sister got her act together before my grandchild gets old enough that I lose interest.

The issue is she has a ton of student debt, around 195k from both undergrad and now law school.\n\nBut over the past year she\u2019s completely changed her mind about law and becoming a lawyer. She now wants to teach and do Teach For America after graduating. She told me this past week. We\u2019ve talked about this at length and she wants to do this because it\u2019s her new dream job (previously it was law). \n\nI\u2019m upset because if she teaches her starting salary will barely clear 35k in the first few years and we live in a really, really expensive city. She has no intention of going back into law later as well as she says law school was a mistake. \n\nLast night we were talking about the future and she mentioned our plans to have kids in a few years and how she\u2019d like to be a stay at home mom in a few years as well. I looked at her and asked how she thinks we\u2019re going to afford that when we\u2019ve got nearly 200k in debt on my one income. She got mad and said I\u2019m trying to use her debt to postpone major life events (like having kids). \n\nWe ended up fighting and I told her she can\u2019t just teach if she expects me to be saddled with her debt as a result. I said she should at least work a high paying job for a few years to repay a good portion. She said I\u2019m prioritizing money over her happiness and that she\u2019s disappointed in my lack of support when they would be my kids and my life as well.\n\nAITA to tell her that if she chooses to go down this path, I may need to rethink our marriage? I haven\u2019t said anything like this yet but I am thinking it. Based on her timeline she\u2019d only work for 3-4 years before becoming a homemaker. I\u2019d have 200k worth of debt to work through completely on my own and I don\u2019t know if I can do it or if it\u2019ll completely ruin the rest of my life. AITA to say this?\n        ",

Whenever sensory overload occurs I tend to react extremely irrational. I also want to state that I made my friend aware of that shortly after we met a year ago or so. Still, my condition does not stop me from attempting to get into situations where sensory overstimulation may occur (such as a party/club), after all, I cant just crawl into my shell all day long everyday.\n\nYesterday, I was in such a situation. My friend and I decided to have a night out at a local club to celebrate her newfound job (shes been jobless for a few months) and just to have a good time in general. Things started out well. Shots were poured, laughs were had and stories were shared.\n\nAfter about 2-3 hours of fun, she suddenly decided to get a cig. Unfortunately, she didnt bring any herself. Instead, she decided to simply go into the smokers area and ask around if anyone was willing to share. She asked me if I would join her, but as an non-smoker I decided against it.\n\nSo she left me to my devices and went for a cig. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, 20 minutes. Slowly, the effects of my last shot were fading away and I started to realize how full the club had become. Music started to appear louder to me, people kept shoving past me and I just felt left alone and sensory overload started to creep in. I felt anxiety and nervousness take hold of me. \n\nI started contemplating trying to find her and tell her but I decided to suck it up and stay put. Dont ask why, but for some reason I didnt want to disturb her smoking session.\n\nJust as about 25 minutes had passed, she suddenly returned. With a guy in tow. She offered him drinks and asked him to join us. I politely shook his hand, but my brain somehow percieved him as just another load onto my already overloaded brain. I also didnt want to put up with being third wheeled that night either.\n\nSo thats when I snapped. My brain was in full fight or flight mode. When she turned to the bar to order new shots, I simply grabbed my coat and walked out. I eventually reached a bus station and got a ticket home. Only when my anger and panic started to fade the realisation crept in that I am probably a massive asshole and moron for leaving her alone in a club at 2 AM. I quickly messaged her, apologizing profusely but trying to explain I acted purely on instinct. She was pretty drunk so she was just confused.\n\nHowever, as I woke up this morning I tried to call her to talk it out and she just snapped at me for not telling her that I felt unwell and accusing me of not trusting that she would understand. Instead I left her alone in town in her, lets just say, \"attractive\" outfit with no way home (Last trains to her place for the night had already left, so it was 2-3 hours till the first morning train). Which is totally fair, thats exactly what I did. I just hadnt thought about any of it while in full flight mode.\n\nShe rightfully lost all trust in me while I have to come to face with the realisation that I didnt trust her either, since I didnt expect her to understand that I was feeling unwell (hence why I didnt tell her). But am I really the asshole in this situation, or should she have been more considerate?\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nTL;DR: Had a sensory overload-induced panic attack in a club, got third wheeled, both of which caused me to get up and leave my friend behind without a word.

We recently bought our first home together after living in an apartment for the past 3 years. She\u2019s going to school for a PhD in biology and is doing great, and I just landed a job as a CPA while I finish my military contract. Everything is perfect... well, almost.\n\nWife has always had reptiles. She had them before I met her, and it is something she is extremely passionate about. She had about 5 snakes, 5 geckos, and a group of communal frogs. She takes great care of them and dedicates a good chunk of her time to them each day.\n\nI was never a huge fan of her creepy crawlies, but she never made me care for them and paid for them all herself so I didn\u2019t mind. I had absolutely nothing to do with them. \n\nThat brings us to our current issue... Wife is pregnant. It\u2019s not unwanted and we\u2019re both very excited, albeit nervous. \n\nI don\u2019t want to bring kids into a household with so many reptiles (possibility of bites, diseases such as salmonella, etc), she is adamant that her reptiles are staying. She said that our kids do not have to interact with or be around the reptiles if I didn\u2019t want them to, but she isn\u2019t getting rid of them because they\u2019re her \u201cpets\u201d and she\u2019s attached to them. We had quite a big argument about this. \n \nShe argued that her reptiles are kept in enclosures that the kids can\u2019t access, in a room that is easily locked, and she is very careful about hygiene and washing her hands after interacting with her reptiles. She also claimed none of her reptiles are dangerous or venomous, so they pose no threat.\n\nI simply don\u2019t feel comfortable with our kids growing up in a house full of reptiles.\n\nAfter our argument, I was angry and ended up putting all of her reptiles on Craigslist to be rehomed. She went away for a few days to take care of something for school and bada bing, bada boom... her reptiles were gone.\n\nShe came home, blew up at me, broke down crying, and asked how I could do this to her. She asked me if I rehomed her first snake, which she\u2019s had since she was 17 years old and raised from a baby. I told her all of them had been rehomed. \n\nShe acted like I killed her dog.

Should I have handled this differently?\n\n**EDIT/UPDATE**: Wow, I wasn\u2019t expecting this much of a response. I never viewed what I did as an asshole move because I guess I viewed her reptiles more like items/belongings that pose a threat to our children, rather than actual living things (which doesn\u2019t make it right, but that\u2019s thought process). I figured most people would agree that reptiles aren\u2019t safe to be in a house with children, and thought I could rally support on here so I could show my wife that I wasn\u2019t alone in my thinking. \n\nBut it\u2019s abundantly clear to me that I fucked up.\n\nI don\u2019t want my kids growing up in a household with reptiles. It was something I should\u2019ve talked to her about before she got pregnant.  I shouldn\u2019t have given her reptiles away behind her back, and yes, it does make me a monster. It was selfish and heartless of me to do, no matter my intentions. And I admit, I am nervous about becoming a dad. I wanted to wait until she finished school, and I\u2019m scared.\n\nI\u2019m likely going to be divorced within the next week or so. I seriously fucked up. I ruined my life and I don\u2019t know what to do. I contacted the buyer this morning and offered to buy all of the reptiles back for double the asking price, no response yet but I explained the situation and have my fingers crossed.\n\nI tried to talk to my wife and apologize but she wants nothing to do with me. She\u2019s inconsolable. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s really going to divorce me yet, but I don\u2019t doubt it.\n\nThanks for calling me out, Reddit. I was a fucking idiot.

Every time I walk to my gym I see this cute little dog looking miserable. The dog (it\u2019s a she) is sometimes with her owner, a homeless guy in his 40s, but most of the time she gets tied to a pole and left there for hours. I wanted to report this to authorities but I was told that because most shelters in our area are kill shelters that could be even worse for the dog. Recently it\u2019s been showing a lot in my city and seeing the poor dog tied to the pole was just too much. A few nights ago my fianc\u00e9 and I were walking back from a restaurant in the area and saw the dog alone again, we decided to take her home. When I told my mother she was outraged, she says homeless people need their animals to keep them company and that I had no right to take her. I told her a dog isn\u2019t a toy and people shouldn\u2019t get one if they can\u2019t look after it. My mom says I\u2019m cruel and don\u2019t care about human beings. I disagree and maintain that you should not have an animal you can\u2019t take care of. We took the dog to the vet, he said she\u2019s a little over a year, malnourished but not critically. We scheduled her shots and made sure she was okay. The plan is either to keep her or let my aunt\u2019s family adopt her. We have two cats (they\u2019re used to dogs) and we\u2019re leaving our apartment to live in a house with a backyard in a few months. On the other and my 8 year old cousin fell in love with the dog from the moment she saw her. Regardless, we all live in the same city and will be there for the doggy to shower her with love. I just hope my mom gets over it.\n\n*For anyone wondering about the legality of what I did, my vet helped me out to make sure the dog was reported as abandoned and everything was legal. We\u2019ll be able to make the adoption official after a 30 day wait period.*\n\nUPDATE: as suggested by some of you in the comments, yesterday my fianc\u00e9 and my brother went to talk to the homeless guy to let him know where the dog is and how to claim ownership. However, authorities ruled this as animal abuse, so if the guy does claim ownership he can face charges (the guy knows this as well). Typically the waiting period for us to adopt the dog if the owner doesn't claim her would be 30 days, but because this is a case of abuse we might be able to finalize the adoption earlier. Seems like my aunt will adopt the dog since they're a family of 5 and someone's always home to take care of the dog. I understand the people telling me I should have talked to the guy earlier and I was a coward for not doing it. For people asking about temperatures, my city is in the mountains in northern Europe, snow and sub-freezing temperatures are a regular occurrence here. For people telling me to return the dog because the homeless guy is lonely, animals don't exist for our entertainment and loneliness isn't a valid excuse for animal abuse. Plenty of homeless people care for their animals and don't leave them alone in the cold.\n        ",

It would have been more ethical to engage in a dialogue with the owner first, helping them understand their pet's needs, and offer assistance if needed and possible, rather than taking unilateral actions. Lastly, the ethical soundness of involving authorities to seize the pet due to accusations of neglect or abuse requires a thorough investigation and fact-checking for fairness.

I don't know the exact arrangement, but I know that he does favors for him in exchange for the rides, such as helping him build a gaming computer. This coworker that needs rides is a compulsive liar, and therefore I'm not totally certain about certain aspects of his life, but he claims the pick-up truck in his driveway is his and he only doesn't drive himself because it's a lot of money for gas.\n\nHere and there, I have filled in for my friend as the ride to work. He is not terribly out of my way, but I do have to drive the opposite way from work to get him. He and I are not friends, I am doing it as a favor to the one who drives him. He is often drunk on Fridays and is prone to hitting on me on the ride home. He doesn't DO anything wrong, but he does say untoward things that make me uncomfortable.\n\nMy friend that is his ride to work had a mental health crisis and quit. He is no longer providing transportation for him, obviously. \n\nThe Friday before last, my boss asked me if I could give him a ride to work. I told him I was willing to give him a ride TO work, but not a ride home. I visit my mother on Friday nights after work because we can't see each other during the week due to our opposing schedules, and I visit my boyfriend out of town on the weekends. We are second shift, so I don't get off work until 11:30 at night. That time with my mom is very precious to me. As petty as it sounds, I am not willing to give even 15 minutes of it to this coworker I'm not close with.\n\nI was assured he would find an alternative ride for him for the ride home. Instead, that night he was waiting for me at my car and told me no one else was willing to do it.\n\nOn Monday, I blew a tire and was unable to make it to work. That night, he texted me the following, \"I might not make it to work tomorrow because I'm having trouble finding a ride.\" I didn't reply, which I realize is rude, but I don't want to be his daily transportation. Some weeks as crazy as it sounds, I literally do not have a penny of extra gas money. The way I felt was, he didn't ask me for a ride. He hinted around it hoping I would offer, and I just don't want to. I would do it out of pity, but I don't want to offer it.\n\nNo one at work thinks I'm being reasonable and all think it's going to be my fault if he gets fired.\n\nAITA?

Also, if there are financial constraints, those are significant factors too. The co-worker could explore other practical options such as public transportation, carpooling with others, or utilizing ride-share apps. Lastly, the workplace is for professional matters and it is not appropriate for colleagues or superiors to pressurize you into giving rides and blame you for job-related consequences someone else might face. Supporting others should never come at the cost of sacrificing personal peace, safety and well-being."

Languages are tools for communication, not barriers or necessities for validation. The expectation that everyone must adhere to a single language, like English in the United States, ignores the spectrum of cultural diversity that exists.

Accusing someone of being disrespectful for communicating in their own language could potentially lead to feelings of alienation and exclusion. Furthermore, creating a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to language violates the principles of mutual respect and understanding, discouraging inclusivity and intercultural dialogue, fundamental values in any diverse society.

Being busy can certainly interfere with one's personal life, but consistently failing to make time for the other individual is seen as neglectful, indicating that the person doesn't value or prioritize their relationship as they should. While the demand of school and work are understood, compromises need to be made. Ignoring the other party's emotional needs, especially when they expressed dissatisfaction, adds gravity to the ethical wrongness at play. Ignoring the partner's 'rant' for a few days can imply a lack of empathy, which is core to any ethical relationship.

I work weekends so I\u2019m always pretty busy but I had two dates that would be the best time for a dinner or something like that since me and my fianc\u00e9 don\u2019t want anything too big. We said we would be happy with a few drinks and not a party with lots of people, we only wanted something low-key since we\u2019re both not really outgoing people.\n\nThat was fine, I told my parents and my mom picked one of the dates. To be very clear, it was agreed that this would be a dinner with only close family on my side, just a dinner with drinks and nothing else.\n\nThen a couple of days ago, in front of most of my close family, my mom announces that we\u2019re having a party in our house which includes my family and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s. Everyone is really excited about it and my sister asks if she can invite her friends as well. Me and my fianc\u00e9 are taken aback and don\u2019t really know what to say and since I\u2019ve been put in an awkward situation, I kind of agree to keep everyone happy.\n\nI talked to my mom later privately and told her again we didn\u2019t want a big party and she agreed, saying it wasn\u2019t going to be \u201cthat big\u201d. I asked how many people would likely be going and she said as many as you want, then listed off all the people on my side that would want to come. I tried to explain that my fianc\u00e9\u2019s close family is quite big and they would not all fit in our house (We both still live with our parents but are trying to move out soon) but she kind of brushed it off and said that we could invite whoever we want.\n\nNow this thing we didn\u2019t want is growing arms and legs. My sister is inviting her friends who are wanting to get their hair professionally done for the party when I\u2019m not even going to that effort myself. A distant family member is coming over from another country and people I barely know from distant parts of my family are asking if I\u2019m having something and giving me very generous engagement presents.

We would probably have to book a venue and catering for all these people going now and we really don\u2019t want to spend massive amounts of money since we\u2019re trying to save.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 says we should just cancel everything and tell everyone the party is off but I\u2019m more reluctant since I don\u2019t want to offend anyone. So we\u2019ve decided to take it to reddit because we\u2019re both suck on what to do and how to handle this without coming off as complete assholes. \n\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I point blank cancelled this unwanted engagement party?\n        ",

Everyone has a right to spend their significant life moments in a way they find the most enjoyable and comfortable. Disregarding their initial wishes and going ahead with a larger party crosses a boundary that imposes on the couple's autonomy.

Finally, such behavior disregards social norms and shared responsibilities, crucial for maintaining harmony in communal spaces like campgrounds."

But here is the problem I've seen my brother play and he is mediocre at best. He's had a twitch account for years and his only followers are a few friends and family. \n\nHe *thinks* the problem is he hasn't devoted enough time to gaming. I went over to his place yesterday because our other siblings asked me to speak to him. I sat him down and tried to explain that gamers need sponsors and capital. The big names go there because they invested thousands of dollars into becoming who they are. That quitting his job and putting the financial burden on our aging parents was selfish of him. Because of course, they aren't going to tell him, no but if they keep supporting him they're going to end up draining their savings and retirement funds leaving them solely with their minuscule social security checks. \n\nThis conversation did not go well at all...his reply for brevity was basically we were all being unsupportive of him and his dreams. That our mother and father believed in him, wanted what made him happy so why couldn't we? That we (ie my siblings and myself) needed to mind our own businesses and not bring him down. \n\nSo as one can imagine he is now quite angry with me and my other siblings. Our parents are siding with him but I don't think I'm in the wrong here in my view he needs to take responsibility for himself and realize that that \"dream\" he's been chasing for now is unattainable and he is burdening the rest of us in the long run because of his monetary choices to pursue this.

This concern arises from an understanding of the importance of retirement savings for elderly individuals.\n2. You are also concerned about your brother's unrealistic expectations and the lack of a steady income, which could lead to financial instability in the future. This concern arises from the understanding that professional gaming is a challenging field with high risk, and not everyone can succeed at it.\n3. Lastly, you attempted to communicate these concerns calmly and rationally, providing your brother with an alternative perspective, which he has the freedom to accept or reject.

The breeder knowingly sent him and other birds out diseased, infecting other birds in the process and killing them.\n\nI received my parrot 8/11/19. He\u2019s my first bird so I researched and bought from a breeder that had reviews and recommendations. He was missing feathers, but the breeder said that he\u2019d been plucked by his siblings, not uncommon but she ought to have told me before shipping him. As his condition worsened, I had him tested for PBFD for $600. PBFD is a disease where parrots lose all their feathers, become immunosuppressed and their bodies necrotize and then they die of that or secondary illnesses. Kind of like AIDs for parrots. When he tested positive, I confronted the breeder to request a refund per the health guarantee. She told me her story. In text. Yeah, she\u2019s not smart. She wasn\u2019t the breeder but had bought the birds from a bird mill to resell them and make money. She had no idea they were all sick, and due to all the refunds she was now bankrupt and couldn\u2019t refund me. She had to move her own parrots out in Jan because they might catch PBFD from the birds she\u2019d had at her house. She knew the birds had PBFD since Jan, but didn\u2019t tell me. I could\u2019ve saved the $600 from testing for his future vet bills. I still just requested a refund for what I paid for my bird. She doubled down on the bankrupt bit and stopped replying.\n\nBecause she didn\u2019t inform me or other buyers, I posted on Facebook to warn others in case they had other birds. It\u2019s a highly contagious disease, so they\u2019re likely to get it and die prematurely. Someone reached out to me and let me know that this breeder had known about PBFD 7/28/19, weeks before even sending my bird out to me because my bird\u2019s sibling that she bought tested positive. In short, she knowingly sent out diseased birds and spread an infectious disease. I love my bird and had bought him with the intention he\u2019d live 30+ years as my companion. Furthermore, this virus has an extremely long lifespan, so if I ever want another parrot, I will have to fumigate my house and deep clean with harsh chemicals.\n\nAfter a consultation with a lawyer, once my bird passes, I have a clear case to sue for intentional emotional distress, damages, vet costs, loss of companionship, and punitive damages. WIBTA if I sue somebody who was essentially really stupid and got scammed by a bird mill into buying/reselling diseased birds and subsequently went bankrupt? She made the decision to lie which was bad enough but then she knowingly sent out diseased birds. I feel bad she's bankrupt and I'm being told she's already suffered enough, it's not right of me to go after her. But I'm the one who has to watch my companion waste away and die in pain. Obviously I'll be euthanizing him when it gets to that point. Suing her is, in my view, justice. But my friends are split and say she\u2019s already bankrupt and it\u2019s \u201cjust a bird\u201d.\n\nEdit: Birb tax, before he lost most of his feathers.

In this case, the breeder acted irresponsibly by knowingly selling diseased birds without informing the purchasers. This has resulted in the suffering of both the birds and their owners. Meanwhile, the individual's proposed legal action seeks to right a wrong and potentially prevent future incidents by holding the breeder accountable. Even though there's sympathy for the breeder's bankruptcy, it doesn't excuse the initial unethical behavior and the damage caused. Hence, the idea of suing could be viewed as a pursuit of justice rather than an act of cruelty against the bankrupt person."

We rent out the garage in my mother's house. I buy my own groceries, I have my own DIY kitchen. I stay to my room and only venture out to the rest of the house to see my mother and siblings or go to the bathroom. \n\nThe other morning I got woken up to loud banging on my door, like really fucking loud. I knew right away it was police as throughout my childhood my house had been raided quite a few times due to my mothers actions. I'm not gonna get specific about what she did/is currently doing, mostly because I try to know as little as possible. \n\nI freaked out because I was butt-naked and they were about to come in any minute. I jumped up and got dressed as fast as I could while my boyfriend tried his best to hide our bong and stash. Not well considering he only had 10-15 seconds. We get pushed out of our rooms and told we are being detained. At this point it's me, my boyfriend, my mum and my sister sitting on the couch in the loungeroom at about 8:30am surrounded by 6 cops. I'm annoyed as all hell because as per usual I'm dragged into whatever my mum has done. After the police do the standard procedures (stating why they're there, showing us proof of the warrant etc.) They ask my boyfriend to come up to our room while they search. They flat out ask him if they're gonna find anything. Knowing that everything wasn't hidden very well and it wouldn't take police long to find it, he told them what they might find. \n\nNaturally they confiscated our bong, weed (about a q), scissors, pretty much anything to do with pot. Because my boyfriend was honest about it and cooperated with the police they gave him a slap on the wrist and told him he had to go to a drug diversion class. Obviously they found jackshit when it came to mum (the actual reason they were there). Now at this point we're kind of annoyed. I call her later that day, in the afternoon while I'm out. I mentioned that my boyfriend and I were gonna take $150 out of the $370 rent we owe. She kind of chuckled and asked why we didn't hide it well. I explained to her that I was completely nude and was focusing my efforts on not being nude. \n\nThe next day I went into my mothers room just to double check with her she knew I was serious about the rent thing. She told me that she wasn't willing to do that because it was our fault we got caught cause we didn't hide it well enough. She also added that a few people had mentioned that I was being unreasonable and that mum was being a pushover. We fought for a bit until she told to me to shut the fuck up so I walked away. Now all I'm wondering is am I being unreasonable? Should I just pay in full and move on?\n\nEDIT: A lot of people mentioned that I should be used to police raids by now. That's my fault for not being clear enough. I said it was a common occurrence throughout my childhood. I had moved out of home with my boyfriend and then when his lease ran up, we decided to sign a lease with my mum. Before we did anything I told her that I was feeling uneasy about moving in with her due to past things like raids and abusive boyfriends. She promised me things would be different and that she was gonna stop doing whatever she does. Obviously that wasn't true.\n        ",

Lastly, the daughter and her boyfriend storing illegal substances in the garage is also against the law, making it ethically problematic.

This is not the first time I have been homeless under her guardianship.\n\nBut I am now an adult, and there is a housing program that I am in for homeless youths that will pay my rent for 8 months or so which will allow me to save up and get a job in that time so I can pay the rent once the allotted time is up. They just need to find a place that meets the program guidelines, and recently my case worker told me she found one that would be perfect and that if I wanted, my mom could stay with me. But I'm not sure I want her to.\n\nFirst of all, it's an efficiency/studio, so it's one room we'd have to share: and my mother is not an easy person to share a room with. She'd also essentially be living rent free, riding off of my opportunity, while she most likely spends her disability money on drugs. I also don't trust the people she hangs out with; she doubles as a dealer and in the last 3 months I've had people actively seeking me out because she owed them money and even threatening to hurt me (can't put the actual details because this sub doesn't allow talk of that stuff). I've thought about maybe having her give me her money so I could budget it and make sure she doesn't spend it on bad stuff, and also only letting her stay if she was sober, but this is not an easy job, plus she is very manipulative/I'm a pushover. I also don't think I'd have it in me to kick her out if I found out she relapsed either.\n\nThat being said, she's my mom and while she hasn't been the best to me, I love her even though I don't like her and I don't think it's fair of me to leave her out on the streets/in the houses of fellow drug users.

He parked in the street a bit further back than normal and was across the street from the neighbors' driveway. \n\nI wake up to pounding on my front door a little after 8:30 and her yelling that she's going to call the cops. \n\nI groggily wake up and throw some clothes on so I can go outside and see what is happening. Its a quiet neighborhood. \n\nAnd this lady GOES OFF. \"I've lived here for 10 years and have never had to deal with this\" (then tried to name the neighbors and could only name one... ) \"Its just common sense not to park there\" \"I leave for work at 4 am and I shouldn't have to maneuver out of my own driveway\" I've also had a lot of workers in and out of the house this week so there was someone parked there earlier this week and she goes \"this is the SECOND time and I left a note and took a picture last time\" which, great for you but whoever it was didn't tell me so idk what you want me to do.  \n\nI just let her get it out. But like... Sure it's inconvenient for her and he has a better place to park. But it's not illegal where we live to park there, it's a public road. So AITA?\n\nETA: I did a bad job describing it. She's across the street from me, off center. So it's her driveway, then her side of the street, then my side of the street, where my roommate parked his car.\n\nETA: She got out of her driveway fine. She wasn't stuck in there for 4 hours. She yelled at me when she got back from work.\n\nETA: 2 second sketch https://i.imgur.com/mSuiXyH.jpg\n        ",

Although it might have been inconsiderate and caused inconvenience to the neighbor, the roommate did not infract any laws or engaged in activities generally seen as universally unacceptable;\n\n2. The street is a public space, which, by definition, allows for anyone to park their car so long as it does not violate residential parking rules or laws;\n\n3. There was no obstruction caused to the neighbor. As per the added information, the neighbor was able to leave for work at 4 am and was not impeded;\n\n4. The roommate's parking situation seems more so a result of necessity, given their work schedule, rather than any intentional disregard for the neighbor.\n\nWhile it would be more harmonious and considerate for the roommate to find another spot to park, the action does not cross into the territory of being ethically unacceptable according to human commonsense."

To give some backstory, when she was in elementary she was the kind child anyone could have known. She always thought to put people before her and overall had a calm temperament. Then she started puberty at around middle school. When she started puberty she turned into an angry, aggressive person. She'd always complain and get extremely angry. She even had issues with harming herself by pulling her hair and scratching her arm. She also began holding grudges from the past, and I do believe it would be caused by her abusive teachers in preschool and a bully she had never told me about until 4th grade (thus we could not have taken action). We did think she had a problem in the beginning, so we treated her with lots of love. During middle school, she had earned an invitation to join a counseling group for girls, and despite us pushing her to go she decided not to go. Over time our daughter grew more and more calm, stopped harming herself, and has become more like herself back when she was young. So I thought it would have been hormones during her puberty years, but this year she asked me to send her to therapy. Now I have thought about it, and I believed she wouldn't require therapy. It was probably the flaring hormones while she was developing, and she has become much more adjusted to become a normal girl. Therapy is extremely expensive around here as well, and we have never mistreated or abused her. And while she had never been mistreated or abused by us, my husband was physically abused by his older brother so I don't see why she needs therapy when her father has never received therapy and yet has turned out completely fine. So therapy would not only be a waste of money, but our daughter has just turned out fine and so would be deemed a waste of time. So would I be the asshole if I don't send my daughter to therapy?\n\nEdit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ck3vzu/wibta\\_if\\_i\\_dont\\_send\\_my\\_daughter\\_to\\_therapy/evsbcht?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ck3vzu/wibta_if_i_dont_send_my_daughter_to_therapy/evsbcht?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The Chain of Thought explanation is as follows:\n\nFirstly, acknowledging and respecting an individual's request for help, especially when it comes to mental health, is a fundamental ethical requirement. Your daughter has explicitly requested therapy which implies a need for professional help in processing her feelings or experiences. Ignoring her request could negatively impact her overall wellbeing.\n\nSecondly, while it can be challenging to understand the scope of an individual's distress without professional training, as a parent, it is important to prioritize a child's mental health irregardless of personal belief or financial concerns. \n\nThirdly, comparing your daughter's need for therapy with her father's ability to cope without it isn't a valid comparison. Emotional coping mechanisms differ greatly among individuals, and what works for one person might not work for another.\n\nLastly, deeming therapy as a waste of time and money is an incorrect assessment as it can be a crucial investment in an individual's future happiness and productivity. If financial constraints are a real concern, looking for less expensive or free resources might be more constructive. \n\nIn sum, refusing therapy despite your daughter's explicit request could be detrimental to her mental health and personal development, regardless of visible improvements or personal judgement about therapy's value."

While there he was gifted an already antique custom made easel that folds up to be portable table top sized and also extends to be full size. There are no others like it and it is estimated to be worth around $5,000-$6,000. I am a painter and my grandpa gave me this easel when I turned 18 before he passed away. I don\u2019t use it, it sits in my paint studio displaying a painting my grandpa made. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were hosting game night with my brother, his girlfriend, and a few other of our friends. My brothers girlfriend needed to use the bathroom but downstairs was occupied so I very clearly directed her upstairs to the one directly to the left of the stairs. Instead she went up to the right, walked 20 feet, turned left, edit: walked another 15 feet, and entered my studio (the door was open) where she somehow managed to knock over the antique easel that was sitting in the far corner of the room and cracked one side of the wood. Luckily the painting was ok but the easel will take AT LEAST $500 to restore (I haven\u2019t gotten an official estimate since this just happened on Saturday). \n\nShe apologized profusely and started crying however she could not tell me why she was in there and not in the bathroom. I told her she needed to leave and I told my brother that since she could not respect my privacy she is not welcome back. I also told him that I expected her to pay for the repairs in their entirety even though I know she does not have that kind of money. My brother says I\u2019m being unreasonable because it was an accident and the door was open so I shouldn\u2019t have expected that room to remain private when I invited other people into my home and never expressly told them to stay out of there. \n\nReddit, AITA?\n\nAdditional info: I have talked to both her and my brother about her violating privacy before. She will go into my brothers phone and read private messages between me and him and then text me about it. She also listens into conversations without my knowledge and then references them when talking to me as if she was part of it. I also caught her holding my phone reading messages that popped up on my lock screen when I left my phone sitting on a table. These examples have all happened multiple times however I have never caught her snooping through my house before. These previous invasions of privacy are why I immediately viewed her being in my studio as an invasion of privacy though.\n\nAdditional info 2: my first edit makes it seem very obvious that I am NTA so I want to make it clear why I am asking as I had tried to keep my initial post as short but still impartial as possible because of the length limitations. My brothers girlfriend (who he has known for 10 years, dating for 2) absolutely has boundary and privacy issues HOWEVER she is not a malicious or vindictive person. I think a lot of her issues come from a place of naivety and extreme insecurity. She grew up bouncing through foster homes and it really did a number on her mental health. She is incredibly intelligent and kind, she just doesn\u2019t know how to respect boundaries AT ALL. I know I am not an asshole for setting those boundaries but am I TA for telling her to leave and not come back then and there? And then making her pay the entire amount even though I genuinely think it was an accident? Also, did leaving my studio door open really imply that the room was ok to go in even though we were all downstairs and the only reason I sent her upstairs was for the bathroom? I genuinely really want to know if I\u2019m crazy for thinking that room should have been safe from anyone wandering in regardless of if they have boundary issues or not.\n\nFinal additional info: the easel was insured under my moms name however long story short the policy lapsed at the end of last year while I was in the process of getting it reappraised and switched to a policy under my own name. Real shitty timing for this to happen and I\u2019m really pissed at myself for not getting the policy switched sooner so I take full responsibility for that. However I was not expecting anyone to be going into my studio and messing around with it so I thought it was safe for the time being.\n        ",

You, as the owner of the damaged antique, have preserves the right to demand reparation for the harm caused, especially given its significant sentimental and monetary value. Furthermore, prior instances of the girlfriend violating your privacy lend credibility to your assumption that she willingly intruded into your paint studio. Her background may explain some of her behavior, but it does not excuse it, especially after clear boundaries have been set. Hence your response, while perhaps severe, falls within the parameters of ethical acceptability. The scenario is ethically acceptable because you are defending your property and personal space from someone who has shown disregard for personal boundaries in the past. However, an effort to understand her situation and negotiate a reasonable way to cover the repair costs would be compassionate, considering her financial situation."

My wife would take V to one of the children\u2019s museums nearby so that she wouldn\u2019t annoy the older girls. \nSince E and L are so close in age, they have some mutual friends so E allowed L to come with her. I guess at school leading up to the weekend L mentioned that she was going to a party and one of her classmates, O, asked if she could come. L asked E, I guess E said yeah. The only problem is that they forgot to tell me. \nSo come party day, I\u2019m rounding everyone up, we\u2019re basically out the door to head to the train station when O and her mom show up.

The parents could have navigated the situation more delicately, potentially extending their resources to accommodate O for that day, and then address the issue of clear communication and proper invitation etiquette with L later.

We were like brothers and we used to hang out every day. He's a good guy but I recently found out he has been dating my younger sister behind my back. I didn't know until now. It was only when my sister announced they were going to get married I knew what was going on. Apparently, they have been dating for many years and engaged for 14 months without telling anyone.\n\nFast forward to today, and my sister announces she's going to get married and the wedding is next week. She invited her whole family to the wedding. I thought maybe she had been secretly dating someone maybe that's why she suddenly is going to get married. And maybe she hid it from me as she knew I would disapprove as I'm overprotective? My sister is the type of girl every guy wants (blonde hair, blue eyes and she's very pretty and has big boobs). A lot of guys hit on her and I'm afraid someone will use her or hurt her so that's why I'm overprotective. But I guess she's going to get married anyway so there's nothing I can do other than to congratulate her. However, the next thing she said shocked me: Her fiance is my best friend. Apparently, they started dating in 2014 and got engaged around Christmas 2018. After hearing this, I felt betrayed and angry. I'm disappointed in both her and my best friend, especially my best friend. No one fucks their best friend's little sister. Nobody does shit like that. To make matters even worse, they hid their relationship from me and my family for 6 years. I'm going to end the friendship with my best friend (a.k.a. future brother-in-law) for being a backstabbing piece of shit. I'm done with him.  \n\nAnyway, I told my sister that I won't go to her wedding or want to have anything to do with her soon-to-be husband and she freaked out. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and give her away (our father died three years ago and I'm her only sibling). But there is no way I'll go to her wedding. I mean my best friend is going to be my brother-in-law? It just feels too weird. So I told her to either walk down the aisle alone or find someone else to do the honor. Well, my sister started crying and begging me to come to her wedding. She says she wants my blessing. But she will never get it because I will never approve of her marriage.\n\nWe then talked with our mother and she said I'm being selfish. She also said that I should go to my sister's wedding. But I said it's my choice whether I'm going or not and no one can force me. However, my sister says I'm a horrible brother and that I hurt her feelings. I know it's her special day but I really don't want to see her fiance again.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. While the feelings of shock and betrayal the brother initially experiences are understandable, refusing to attend the wedding based on these feelings is ethically questionable. The sister and the best friend have autonomy in their choices and have not done something morally egregious by hiding their relationship. It is ethically wrong for the brother to refuse support to his sister on her big day and sever ties with his friend purely out of feelings of betrayal. This incident is a communication and trust issue rather than a moral outrage. What's unacceptable here in human common-sense ethics is the brother's reaction to the facts once they are revealed. His refusal to forgive, communicate and leave room for reconciliation harms relationships, creating unnecessary pain for everyone involved, particularly for his sister on her wedding day. He is effectively punishing his sister and best friend for their lack of transparency by withdrawing his support, instead of grappling with the motivations and consequences behind their actions."

We all moved in at the same time about a year ago and the landlord does not live in the house. Early on it became clear that unless I did most of the maintenance (snow shoveling, yard work etc.) it would not get done by anybody. I honestly don't mind doing it as I would rather look at a nice neat home and it gives me an excuse to get outside. That being said I have never even had gotten so much as a \"thanks\" from anyone else in the house.\n\nI wont deny that this has built up a fair bit of resentment. The main floor tenants are also very inconsiderate with noise. Stomping in the doors and walking around with boots and hard shoes at night, having parties mid week and leaving their yappy dogs home alone barking all night on a regular basis. I have never complained to the landlord or the city about the noise and always addressed them directly in a respectful way rather than trying to get them in trouble.\n\nClearly this is about more than just Tide pods.\n\nWe share a laundry room with the main floor tenants and the top floor tenant has their own. There is a row of cupboards and we each have our own to keep laundry and cleaning supplies in and to this point I just trusted that no one would steal things like that from their neighbour. Well I had noticed that we seemed to be going through our pods rather quickly so I took a peek in their cupboard and saw that they didn't have any of our own so I decided to do a little experiment. I simply counted how many were in the tub waited until they did laundry and then counted them again. Sure enough there were two pods less. So I took the remaining pods out of the laundry room and left the empty tub on the dryer with a note that said \"buy your own, thief.\"\n\nFor what it's worth if they had asked I would have gladly given them whatever they needed.\n\nLater on that day one of them texted my S/O apologizing and saying they were \"in a bind\" and would replace the pod later. They played it off as if it was a one time thing which I do not believe although admittedly o do not have any proof one way or the other. Either way later on that day there was a whole new tub of pods outside my door. \n\nI am satisfied with the outcome.

Well my friend hated it, like a lot and on the date I decided to bring it up.\n\nMind you, I didn't bring it up to discourage this person in anyway, I even told them that I have a story about their music but I'm not sure if I should tell it. Well he seemed eager to at least hear it so away I told the story.\n\nNow there is a bit of a long list of other awkward things that happened such as me excessively swearing at other drivers, apologizing because I was oversharing and talking about my anxiety, as well as me driving like absolute shit because I was nervous (I'm also a fairly new driver) which I won't bother to go over at this point. Overall though I didn't feel like it was too bad (it was a bad date but not a disaster) I was also being told not to worry so much but I still did.

I also attempted a high five before that when saying bye which was also insanely awkward in delivery.\n\nSo I drive home pretty upset because I feel like I really made myself look silly and post some things to cheer me up, and by morning things were fine but later the following day I made a joke about whether or not I would embarrass myself that day (which I didn't think was a big deal) but  by the end of my shift I've been blocked by my date.\n\nThat upset me a bit too, but I got a bit curious and felt like there had to be some reason for it, I wasn't blocked on one of their social medias which was linked with their music and everything and found they had been talking about the situation with my friend not liking their music on there.

There's also the issue of embarrassing self-depreciating humor made online following the date, which could've made the date feel awkward or even pity them. Not openly discussing concerns with the date about their reactions, but rather digging into their posts on social media, is also ethically off mark.

My thirteen year old daughter (let's call her Kaitlyn) has been playing piano since she was five. My wife and I have always pushed her to be disciplined in her piano practice. She plays piano for an hour and thirty minutes per day.  Unless she is sick or we are traveling away from home, she never misses a day of practice. Keep in mind that we always have her make up the time that she misses. We allow her an amount of leniency by letting her make up the time over a week's interval. Kaitlyn has never protested about her piano routine and we always believed that she enjoyed it. Yesterday, she was invited to a sleepover with her cousin. I told her that she could go and reminded her that she would have to make up her piano time, preferably before the sleepover. To my surprise, Kaitlyn said that she didn't want to and that it was just a day so it didn't matter much. Of course, I put my foot down and said that she couldn't go to the sleepover unless she followed her piano regimen. Surprisingly, my wife sided with Kaitlyn and said that I should let her skip a day, just this once. I said that if we allowed Kaitlyn to miss a day once, she would take advantage of our leniency and continue to skip days.

From my view, she can. This summer she has had two sleepovers.\n\nEdit: UPDATE: After reading all of your comments my wife and I had a talk with Kaitlyn. She told us that while she still enjoyed piano and piano competitions, she felt that she could manage her piano practice on her own. She also said that I am trying to make her more Asian than she is (technically she's Afro-Asian), which is something that I never knew she felt. We agreed that she could make the decisions on her piano regimen (provided that she plays around six hours a week) and that she could go to the sleepover with her cousin without making up the piano time.

The insistence on not skipping a day of piano practice, even for a cherished sleepover, indicates an overpowering control over Kaitlyn's choices. This overrides the socially and ethically accepted practice of nurturing a child's independence and decision-making skills, which are crucial for their holistic development. The attitude of allowing Kaitlyn no exceptions undermines her capability to responsibly manage her commitments, which, as proven later, she is capable of doing. Ethically, it's acceptable to promote discipline and commitment but not at the cost of disregarding a child's personal desires or suppressing their emotional needs. Furthermore, the initial dismissal of Kaitlyn's desire to skip piano for a day implies a lack of empathy and understanding, which is ethically questionable in a parental role. However, the resolution, where Kaitlyn's autonomy is acknowledged and accepted, indicates ethical improvement in response to the initially unacceptable stance."

His friends were going to the park with their parents, and Jake wanted to go with them. I wanted to be back in time to make dinner so I said if we went then we needed to leave by 4:30. Jake agreed, so I took him. We arrived at 3:20. At 4 I gave him a 30 minute warning. At 4:30 I tell him it's time to go. The other kids and their parents left. I gave it 5 minutes and then told him again. Jake asks for 5 more minutes. I say fine but then we need to leave. At 5pm, several warnings later, it's started to rain and we were meant to leave 30 minutes ago. I say \"you've had extra time, we've been here nearly 2 hours, it's time to go home. Now.\" Jake says no. Out of frustration I call Rose, who tells me to try one more time and be sterner, so I do. When that doesn't work she asks to be put on speaker, and then in her mum voice she says \"Jacob Middlename Lastname! Get in the car now!\". It works.\n\nI am now embarrassed and pissed off, because I was telling him to leave for 30 minutes, and Rose got him to leave immediately over the phone. I start driving home and I don't rant or yell but I say that I did him a favour taking him so I expect him to not play up like this. Jake says he was just having fun. I get more annoyed and tell him that because he delayed us for 30 minutes, he can either have the equivalent of 15 demerits or he can be grounded for the rest of the week. Up to him. I know I went in really strong considering it was only half an hour but I was tired, embarrassed, angry, wet, and Jake was acting like he'd done no wrong.\n\nWe got home, I told Rose what I said. She said \"I really wish you hadn't done that\". I remind her that she told me I could. She then reminds me that as she and her ex split custody and agreed to uphold the same reward/punishment system the 15 days or demerits will now carry into his week with Jake.\n\nRose says that in order to handle this and for me to save face with Jake she wants me to offer him some sort of deal, like if he apologises then I lower it to 5 days or demerits.\n\nThe way I see it is I can't back down at all. This is the punishment I set, and while it was in the heat of the moment, it will stop him from doing it again. Jake pulled that shit in the park because he didn't think I'd punish him. If I back down now then he will walk all over me.\n\nAITA for refusing to back down?\n\nInfo: Jake is 10, Rose is 29, I'm 30.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The core moral issue at hand here is the handling of authority and punishment. Your punishment was arguably too severe for a relatively minor infraction on Jake's part, given that he's a 10-year-old child. The communication and agreement between you and Rose on acceptable punishments seems lacking as well. While you do have authority to discipline Jake, it's crucial to apply it fairly and not let anger dictate the severity of the punishment. Having clear, agreed upon rules for discipline would prevent such issues and ensure that you are both acting in Jake's best interests. Additionally, it's notable that telling the child what the consequences are prior to the action would likely encourage better behavior."

My wife and I have been together for 5 years. I love her so much that it pains me to write this. The thing is, I was the sole earner for a while and I was happy to provide (I am a software developer at a local startup that has tripled in employees and gone exponential in revenue). We're not having kids, so my wife got bored of being home and doing nothing. So she got a job at a law firm as a paralegal. \n\nEnter this attorney, who I'll call Brandon. My wife started to bring him up quite a bit. You know when your wife starts talking about something, drops it, and then brings it up again a few minutes or hours later like there was no gap? My wife does that with stories about him. I searched through her Facebook friends list one day for \"Brandon\" and saw that they had connected. Okay... Then my wife starts going to work happy hours and I'm seeing pictures of the guy on her timeline. In most of the pictures she is positioned next to him, holding a drink. Okay...\n\nI have gained considerable weight since joining the startup. There is free food provided to us nearly every day. My wife has maintained a really low weight and looks as beautiful as she did at 22. Brandon is more like how I used to be weight wise. However, I believe I make more money than he does.\n\nSo here it goes... I take off work on Friday, as my team is nearing the end of our project. I wait for my wife to leave the firm and I see her walking out with Brandon. They get in my wife's car, purchased on my dime, and I follow them for a bit. They go to a local dive bar and it turns out all of her coworkers are there - I see them entering. I wait for hours and everyone eventually leaves. My wife leaves last with Brandon and she takes him home. I don't see any physical contact as he exits the vehicle to go inside his apartment building.\n\nAt this point, I'm sick. I'm gutted. I wait at home for my wife and confront her about Brandon. She went insane basically, threatening to end the marriage because I stalked her. She told me she is always the DD for happy hour because she doesn't drink much (which is true), but she didn't address my greater concerns. AITA?\n\n \n\nTL;DR Followed my wife one evening because of her weird relationship with an attorney at the firm she joined\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. Here is the chain of thought that led to this conclusion: \n\n1. Spousal Trust: In a healthy relationship, there should be a strong bond of trust and respect. This trust was violated when the one spouse followed the other without her awareness, which shows a lack of confidence and respect in their relationship.\n\n2. Privacy: Every individual, regardless of being in a relationship, is entitled to personal privacy. Following one's spouse or prying into their activities without their consent invades this privacy.\n\n3. Direct Communication: Instead of sharing his concerns directly from the beginning with his wife regarding the suspicious behavior, the husband chose to treat his spouse with suspicion and stalked her, which is not ethically sound. Conflicts or suspicions should be dealt with by having open and clear communication.\n\n4. Reaction to Confrontation: The reaction to being skeptical and accusatory without substantial evidence only fosters negativity and mistrust in the relationship. This approach could potentially damage the relationship severely.\n\nOverall, the husband's actions in this scenario are ethically unacceptable as they breach trust, invade personal privacy, and ignore healthier alternatives such as direct communication."

I'll describe the event that was the catalyst to our break up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was during exam period for university. 3 days before my first exam, we went on a casual date to the local mall. I thought it would be good to meet up and release some of our stress. We had Chinese noodles for lunch. While eating, we got talking. I was telling her about a YouTube video I watched the other day. It was an informative speech made by a psychologist about cheating. The psychologist explained most cheaters don't go out of their way to cheat. And when it happens, most people are surprised they're doing it themselves. It's almost unexpected. She also explained how cheating has existed for a very long time where we probably won't be able to get rid of it as a social condition. I felt I learned a different perspective of cheating and thought to share this to my gf at the time. I didn't notice anything wrong straight away. The meal continued as normal and we talked about different things as well. When we finished the meal, we paid and proceeded to browse the shops. She got progressively worse and when I asked her what was wrong it was like she was having an anxiety attack. She wouldn't talk to me for the remainder of the date and we walked out of the mall back to the car. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne the way back and in the car, I occasionally tried to start up a conversation but she felt silent. I was growing more flustered and had no idea what was going on. She began by questioning me and asking me questions about cheating. I answered and was thinking through the topic as well. It's safe to say I have never thought about some of the questions she asked me in a proper and serious manner. Especially considering how flustered I became, the environment where we had this talk wasn't calm in the least. Our discussion kept on going around in a circle and it felt like she wasn't listening to me at all and only feeding into her own fear. She kept on brushing off everything I said and wasn't taking it in at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe finally asked me \"Would you ever cheat on me?\" Part of me knew obviously to say \"No.\" Even if I agreed or disagreed, I understand feelings are still important. The other half wanted to stay true to me and my way of thinking. I was thinking about what the lady said in the video and how things can just happen. I also didn't want to say a promise I couldn't keep. In the end I chose to say something along the lines of not answering with a firm no. Something like \"I cannot promise you that\". She got very sad and upset. That was the last time we ever talked in person. I sent a very long apology text later that night after thinking it through. I knew I had hurt her. However, I wanted to explain my side and how I couldn't betray myself and my way of thinking. Unfortunately she couldn't understand my perspective. She explained how she couldn't forgive me for saying something like that.\n        ",

It was absolutely fair for him to discuss his beliefs or the psychology behind cheating, however, the way he handled the 'potential cheating' question was not appropriate. While being honest is important, reassurances are key in relationships, as they help build trust and alleviate insecurities. Rather than resorting to a vague and potentially damaging reply like \"I cannot promise you that\", he could have reassured her about his commitment to their relationship but also highlighted it's something everyone should actively work on. This would have balanced honesty and reassurance, thereby adhering to an ethical and empathetic approach.

Americans don't really do sausage rolls. So my father makes a couple tray fulls for us that we freeze and can just throw into the oven for an easy dinner. We don't do it often because we really enjoy them & want them to last, especially since my father making this last batch was a real strain because he's been sick (cancer, but in remission just weak). \n\nSo I told my ex (lives with us because we have a kid together)that my father & I were making sausage rolls for dinner and I may make some fries and cheese sauce with them since he doesn't like sausage rolls.

I don't think she took them out of homesickness because I think she would have taken the more traditional stuff like my kimmidolls instead. as of atm, she will still be staying with us. we don't think she has the motive to steal anything else and as mentioned before I put everything in a box/packed it away so she couldn't take something else. and lastly, she definitely would've been aware of what she was doing because she's 16-17.\n\nhopefully that answered the faq, also I don't need anymore judgement comments, I've got my answer.\n        ",

From a commonsense perspective, you have a right to reclaim your property. However, it's also important to acknowledge the violation of privacy involved in going through the exchange student's belongings. A conversation about the situation might have been a more diplomatic approach. Ignoring this grey area, the self-defense principle in property rights indicates that the move was indeed justified, as you were safeguarding and retrieving your stolen items.

A fundraising scheme suggested by the British, Macmillan Cancer Charity. I'm sure the charity is well-meaning and think this is a fun and novel way of raising money and awareness, however, I think this is trashy and so disrespectful to cancer sufferers who are just fighting to stay alive.   I also hate the \"look at me, look at me, aren't I wonderful for caring\" narcissistic mentality that has crept into society. Shaving your head in no way helps you empathize how someone is suffering the emotional and physical trauma that cancer brings. To pretend otherwise is unhelpful and in poor taste. I did commend her good intentions and suggested a donation instead though but told her absolutely not.   She is unhappy and now sulking for my lack of support.\n\n\\*As a side note, my daughter doesn't know but my friend from work has breast cancer and shaved her head a couple of days ago, just before her next chemo. It broke her heart as she loved her long hair. I can't see this being positive for anyone who really has to go through this.

It is seen as disrespectful to trivialize their pain by equating a voluntary act of shaving hair with the involuntary hair loss due to chemotherapy. This wrongfully paints a picture that empathy for those suffering can be achieved through such acts. Additionally, your decision seems to overshadow your daughter's intentions. She's trying to show solidarity with a cause she cares about and raise funds - her act is not primarily about empathizing, but contributing in a measurable way. Overriding this suggests she doesn't have agency to express her compassion the way she finds effective. Finally, using your work friend's condition as justification seems ethically flawed as it's kept a secret from your daughter. If she were aware, she might either be more motivated or reconsider her decision, thus it impacts her autonomy. Therefore, while your concerns are understandable, it's ethically unacceptable to disregard your daughter's autonomy and intent, based on personal biases and undisclosed information."

My husband has this pattern of relaxing on things whenever I give him positive reinforcement, we'll get to that later, and so instead of complimenting him, reminded him about the factor of floating weight. He did not respond to it until this evening when  he stepped on the scale with his clothes on and said that the reason he gained some weight was because he usually weighs it when he's nude, and then again I responded that floating weight is a thing. He then got incredibly upset and said that he needs encouragement from me, and not negative feedback, otherwise he'll feel like he's not making any progress. I tried apologizing and explaining that it wasn't negative, and that he seems to have a pattern of gaining the weight back whenever I compliment him, and said that I felt that the best thing to do would to be to not compliment and remain neutral.\n\nHe then blamed it on other factors; like the time I got kicked out of Planet Fitness was what made him stop exercising and made him gain the weight back (then afterward said \"I'm not blaming you for that\" as if that would make it feel like I'm not being blamed for getting kicked out.)\n\nI then tried apologizing again, and tried giving another example of how me giving positive reinforcement doesn't work for him, as he does not do his chores or help clean the house on his own, as he needs me to tell him to and then compliment his work when he is finished. He then responded \"Oh so we're making this about that now?\"\n\nFrustrated, I left the room, saying that he's not entitled to my emotional labor.

My back would get really sweaty from sitting on some of the leather work-out machines, so I would bunch up the bottom half of my shirt and tie it so it wouldn't stick to my torso. The manager told me not to do that because it could possibly 'intimidate' some of the other female gym goers but I kept doing it anyway out of absentmindedness and the second time she caught me she started getting really aggressive about it and threatened to kick me out. I told her I wouldn't put up with her talking to me that way and then she replied \"then leave.\" So I did. It's kind of embarrassing because I feel like I could have handled it better and I didn't think it was important to the story so I left it out. So TLDR: dress code violations. \n        ",

I Hope I did it in time that the man didn't see anything, but even with the duvet covering me I still felt kinda vulnerable and embarrassed to have a stranger staring in at me in my bedroom like this. It's a pretty small room with a proportionately large window, (The window takes up just over half th wall space) so I felt a bit like a goldfish on display.\n\nMy husband had a short exchange with the guy of about 20-30 seconds, throughout which I was whispering through clenched teeth for him to close the blind. When he was finally done and the man had gone I started asking, 'Why did you do that?' At which point he suddenly burst into anger at me, and started ranting in an almost yell, asking why I have to always over-react/\nThrow a fuss about things that don't matter (I Can't recall his exact wording)\n\nAt this point I felt a bit guilty and started questioning myself. I Am a very private, easily embarrassed, and somewhat prudish person. I Wonder if maybe this wssn't something I should've felt embarrassed or gotton annoyed about.\n\nNow I look back, I wonder if it's really as bad as a thought in the moment. For one, I was able to lift the duvet over myself in time so I was covered, plus I was positioned behind my husband in a way that the man may not have even had a clear view of me, and also my husband was aswell himself just in a t-shirt and boxers, so was in the same postion as I was and if anything was exposing himself  even more than he was me.\n\nSo, was a just being silly and wrong to complain?\n        ",

I immediately thought of this subreddit to come to and vent. (also am on mobile). This will also be very long. \n\nSome backstory: I've recently turned 16, and my brother 15, when father has recently opened up a cafe, and it has a rustic farmhouse theme, seeing that it is situated in an eco village, and next to a horse riding place (don't know the official word for it). Because of this, there are a RIDICULOUS amount of flies, and many, many rooster calls. The cafe also came with a small piece of land next to it, so he decided to make it a venue for hire for BBQs and parties.\nHe forced me and my brother to work there from 7 till 7 every day of the week, without a single penny paid to us. Seeing that we started our summer holiday, it was very convenient for him, and not for me and my brother.\n\nNow for the main event.\n\nIt started yesterday, and it being a Saturday, I prayed for the 1% chance of me avoiding work, but you can guess how that went. I begrudgently went with my dad to work, and I really wasn't in the mood. At 12 o clock hayfever hit me harder then 911, and my sinuses were as fucked up as Hong Kong's situation. My auntie came over it visit us at work, and immediately noticed (she's like my 2nd mom) and told my dad I'm not fit to work. Like seriously, you could look at my red, snotty face for a split second and see that. My dad on the other hand WA having none of it, and forced me to continue to SERVE customers and wash dishes.\n That night people also rented out to braai ( our version of BBQ) and I was not prepared for that at all. I ended up to staying till 11 at night, in sandals, shorts and a t-shirt. I finally left because my aunt came to pick me and my bro up. (thank you saviot aunt). My dad was really pissed, but I didn't care.\n\nSo this morning my dad picked us up, I took some allergex, and we went back to work. After working and napping (like you in classwith your head on the table) till 12, we had lunch. My father told me to eat, but I was tired, so I said no. He warned me again, I didn't respond. 5 minutes later I got up and went to go eat. I cut me some French loaf, and went to eat by myself. Someone (my lazy cousins who visited) then cut for them and made a huge mess, crumbs everywhere, on the counter in which we served customers.\nMy dad got up, stood in front of it, and said that I must come clean it up NOW. I said nah, I'm busy eating. He lost it. He asked if I don't care that a customer can come in and see this mess, I said of course not, I'm busy eating. He kicked me out and send my off the premises.\n\nSorry if I made mistakes, this actually my first story I ever on reddit and probably has plot holes because of 3000 word limit\n\nTL;DR: My father kicked my out of his Cafe for me not caring if a customer saw the place in a mess.\n        ",

It's understandable for the protagonist to be more concerned with personal needs such as eating, and not fully grasp the importance of maintaining a clean environment for customers, which they may view as a minor issue compared to their basic needs like hunger. The child's actions reveal a lack of engagement and reluctance due to forced labor and no monetary reward. However, from an ethical standpoint, as a family-run business expecting children to pitch in, regardless of wage argument, helps them learn skills and responsibility which is common in many cultures. There could be misunderstanding due to communication gaps, cultural differences, and generational ideals. This does not negate the fact the father's methods can be seen as harsh.

This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour.

I then noticed that I drank all of it. Then I had this sudden urge to use the restroom. The class was going to start in 5 minutes, and the teacher is strict about students arriving late. I rushed down the hallway and went down the stairs. I then ended up tripping down the stairs and feeling my shoulder pop out. I freaked out and had my nearby friend in the class drive me to the campus urgent care. I ended up calling my dad because I was afraid that something was severely wrong with my shoulder. He heard my story and responded with caring words, and I felt comforted. I ended up having a very slight injury with my shoulder and had to wear a shoulder sling for a few days. Everything was going fine till I get a text from my sibling asking if i \u201cfell down the stairs at the university bar while getting drunk.\u201d This immediately pissed me off, so I went to my other siblings and a family friend and they said the same thing too. I asked who told them that and they said my dad did. Firstly, it was 1:55 pm on a Wednesday. Secondly, I was in our university math building. Thirdly, wtf check my schedule I was supposed to be in math at 2. I didn\u2019t say anything to my dad, because I felt like it wasn\u2019t my place to get mad at him. Then a few days later my family friend tells me that my dad thinks I\u2019m pregnant???? I ask her why, and she says that my dad said, \u201cPregnant people get dizzy. So (my name) fell down the stairs because she was dizzy and pregnant.\u201d My sibling then tells me he heard the same thing from my dad. It also turns how he told many people this story. Firstly, I\u2019m on birth control. Secondly, why was he spreading around something that was completely untrue. Thirdly, that\u2019s such a fucking reach?? This made me overly pissed so I confronted my dad, and he agreed that he made those statements. I then told him to, \u201cfuck off, and don\u2019t spread rumors that are completely untrue.

The reason is that you, as the subject of damaging rumors originating from your own dad, have a right to confront him and express your disappointment and anger.

It's important to remember that respect is a two-way street. While the use of strong language (\"fuck off\") is generally frowned upon, in this case, it might be justified by the level of harm done and the need to send a clear message that his actions were not acceptable. Events leading up to your outburst demonstrate that you had been patient and reasonable, so expressing your indignation isn't out of line.

Talking about how to get our somewhat overweight kid more healthy, she said every meal has to include lots of salad. I pointed out that typically I cook vegetarian anyway - for example last night's meal was whole-meal pasta with (lots of) vegetables cooked in a tomato sauce - and that I don't think such meals typically need salad. At this point I could tell by her standard signals that she had suddenly got fairly upset. She started talking about how she has a right to salad at every meal. It's relevant at this point that I do about 2/3 of the cooking and my cooking is more work - she is more likely to do instant food, I chop more vegetables. She does sometimes add, say, a raw carrot to what I have provided, but by no means always. I said that when I cook, I feel like I'm providing a complete meal, and so I would feel put out if she was to add salad to it when I didn't as cook deem it necessary. I said this isn't a strange way to feel as someone who has cooked a meal for their family.\n\nIn repeated circles of argument, I have pointed out that I have never and will never stop her eating salad, but I can't help that I feel like meals I provide should be regarded as sufficient, so I can't help feeling slightly put out if she acts like they are not, by adding salad at the last minute when I cooked something I didn't intend to include salad with.\n\nIt's relevant that in her culture (Swedish) it is more normal to have a salad with absolutely everything, and not in mine (British). I pointed out that I understand her food-related desires and therefore will never try to stop her adding salad to what I cook, but I also pointed out I feel like she is making no attempt to understand how I feel.\n\nHer repeated response was \"You have dropped a bomb-shell. I need salad with every meal but now I know every time I make salad when you cook you'll be feeling bad about it, this is terrible\". And she remained really angry and has now gone to bed angry.\n\nI feel like she has over-reacted, that she got quickly angry rather than calmly allowing us to explore each other's valid but conflicting feelings.

I need to tell myself that here. I\u2019m as mystified as the rest of you as to why I care about salad.

While the speaker is feeling unappreciated when his wife adds salad to the meal he cooks, it's important to note that everyone has the right to adjust their meals according to their preferences, if it is not harming someone else. It is understandable that the cook may expect appreciation for his efforts but to insist that no alterations should be made to the meal is limiting the autonomy of the spouse. This altercation is indicative of communication issues in the relationship as well, which heighten the emotional responses of both parties instead of finding a compromise or mutual understanding."

I\u2019m twenty years old and only recently came into a well-paying job and got smarter with my spending. \n\nI\u2019ve had a friend since junior year of high school, who whenever we would go out and I was strapped for cash, would often pay my bill. Wether it be for a bite to eat or going mini-golfing/bowling or whatever. He always expected payments which I would always pay back. When I couldn\u2019t pay him back in a time he considered acceptable, he would berate me, saying that I waste all my money on my girlfriend or that I\u2019m not wise with how I spend my money on my car, albeit car payment, basic upkeep, as well as some personal upgrades (but it\u2019s my damn money, after all). \n\nRecently he himself has a new relationship with a woman who herself has no job, a massive amount of college debt, and a spending problem. He has lost most of his savings because of it, and I have sat on the sidelines with my mouth shut, for fear of him throwing it back in my face. A few nights ago, he told me he was going up to her college (about a four hour drive) and asked if he could borrow some gas money (nothing too huge, about $50-$60). But I denied him, as I thought back to all the times he would berate me for asking him. I didn\u2019t call him out, or tell him he\u2019s spending too much money, or nothing. I\u2019m currently all paid up to him and I feel as though he has his money and I have mine. \n\nTLDR; My friend asks for money. I deny him because he would berate me if I asked him to do the same.

Firstly, the friend took advantage of his position to berate and criticize the person's financial choices whenever repayment was delayed. This indicates a lack of respect and understanding of his friend's circumstances. Secondly, the lack of consideration is exhibited again when the friend asks for financial assistance while treating his own money irresponsibly. It can appear as if he is taking his friend's generosity for granted. However, the person's decision to give him money in the end, despite these issues, is a sign of his kindness and understanding of reciprocity in friendships, which shows ethical behavior on his part. Nonetheless, the friend's actions remain ethically problematic by human common sense due to the lack of empathy, understanding, and respect towards his friend's financial conditions and efforts."

I could tell she knew I didnt tip because i left no bills on the table and I was paying in cash.\n\nI told her yes, but i dont want to get into right now, thanks.

The first day of my new job was an orientation and I was surprised to see that she was going to be working there as well. After our first training shift together, she started to explain her family hardships and how difficult it had been not having her license. I\u2019ve been in this boat before: I got a DUI myself when I was a teenager, and it took me years to save up enough to buy a new car and reinstate my license and I definitely learned from my mistake right away.

I honestly felt bad for her and offered her a ride home that day, not really caring if she was out of the way, but she explained she was \u201cright off ____ street\u201d as well. So that day I gave her a ride home. Now, she asks me for a ride every time we work together, which has been every single shift. We do live off the same road, but her house is 15 minutes in the opposite direction so I have to leave 30 minutes early and arrive home 30 min late at night. It\u2019s especially frustrating that I often see her moms or her brothers cars in the driveway when I pull up, which means she probably could have found another ride. She\u2019s given me a $5 bill twice, which I appreciate, but my car is a gas-guzzler and that\u2019s not really covering what I\u2019m paying to give her rides every day.

It gives me major anxiety but I do feel kind of like I\u2019m being taken advantage of. \n\nTl:dr I want to tell my coworker that she needs to find another way to get to work but I empathize with her because I had to depend on other people for rides just a couple years ago.\n        ",

Furthermore, her intent to cheat off you during the test shows a lack of respect for your efforts, undermining your friendship. Thus, it is reasonable to protect your interests and demand respect. You are not ethically obligated to disadvantage yourself for her comfort. Your empathy is commendable, but not at the cost of your own well-being."

Even if the teacher's behavior is creepy, it's not ethical to use such tactics to gain advantages. The proper course of action would have been to report the teacher's behavior to a trusted authority like parents, the head of the year, or the school principal. Secondly, the teacher is also at fault, as he should not compromise on academic integrity by yielding to the blackmail and agreeing to raise the grade. He should maintain professional conduct and grade students based on their performance and merit, not based on threats or personal issues.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The chain of thought here is that animals, much like humans, have feelings and emotions. They can fear, feel distressed and uncomfortable. In this situation, the dog is showing clear signs of fear and discomfort toward the behaviors of the sister. Ignoring those signals and continuing those behaviors is potentially causing psychological harm to the dog. As the current primary caretaker of pet, you have ethical obligations to ensure its wellbeing. By not allowing your sister to continue to stress the dog, you're prioritizing the dog's emotional and physical well-being which is a responsible and ethical decision. Your attempt to educate your sister and mother about the issue also show your concern for the well-being of the dog, which is an ethically right action. In the perspective of human commonsense, taking care of the vulnerable and advocating for those who cannot communicate their distress, such as pets, is generally considered much more ethical than ignoring their distress signals."

Well, as anyone with small children knows, sometimes they get distracted playing and don't realize they need to go the bathroom until it is *urgent*. Then they have to try and run inside across the house to the bathroom. This has resulted in a number of accidents, which are no big deal individually but annoying to deal with frequently.\n\nSo I dug them a little hole between our shed and the back fence, and told them they could pee in the hole. I figure if it starts to stink or some other problem arises, I can bury it. The back fence is cedar so nobody can see them, but it is a shared fence with the neighbor. My kids aren't quiet, and they excitedly laugh and say loudly \"I'm going pee!\" so my neighbors will probably eventually find out (if they don't know already), and may even notice that they're always peeing in the same place.\n\nThey have never pooped out there, but their accumulated pee could probably still stink at some future point, especially if we don't get a lot of rain. Obviously I make my boys wash their hands before they come in and eat. They are always digging holes and playing in the dirt and making \"werewolf soup\" (a gross concoction of dirt and grass and rocks and sticks in a bucket of water) anyway, so the sanitation is covered. But I don't know if I should try and force my boys to keep it a secret or not let them pee outside or something.\n\nWe don't really know these neighbors very well because we just moved in a year and a half ago. These are smallish suburban lots of 1/4 acre typical of the neighborhood. We've met because I removed a major portion of our plum tree that was encroaching on their space. But we're not close friends or anything because even though our backyards touch, we live on separate streets. They did build their house quite close to the back fence (maybe 15-20 feet from the pee area). They also have a large labrador-sized dog that obviously does it's business in their backyard, which is fine and doesn't bother us since it's their yard (we don't have a dog, but I do have 9 chickens). I just don't want to gross out my neighbor by allowing humans to go out there. AITA for designating an outdoor latrine area next to a shared fence for my two little boys to pee?\n\nEDIT: I hear you.

Harm to Living Beings: Pouring wet cement on a puppy or any living creature would cause severe pain, suffering and possible death. It's fundamentally wrong to cause intentional harm to innocent and defenseless beings.\n   \n2. Violation of Animal Rights: Animals have the right to be treated with kindness and respect, which this scenario completely disregards. It's generally agreed upon that cruelty towards animals is ethically wrong.\n\n3. Legal Implications: In most societies, animal abuse is illegal, implying common agreement that such actions are ethically and socially unacceptable.\n\n4. Empathy and Compassion: Human commonsense is strongly influenced by feelings of empathy and compassion towards other beings, especially those that are vulnerable like puppies. This scenario defies these basic human feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, causing harm to a living creature is considered ethically unacceptable because it contradicts the values of regard for life, empathy, and the protection of the vulnerable."

The anger expressed by the 13-year-old is also inappropriate given the situation. It's natural to want to be part of an important family moment, but it's also essential to respect boundaries. The parents and the brother and his partner have the right to decide who should attend based on their comfort and preferences. They could have various reasons for their decision, such as maintaining a calm environment, privacy, or considering who would be most helpful during that high-stress time. The brother's claim of bias may stem from disappointment, but it is crucial to put emotions aside and consider other perspectives. In conclusion, the conduct could be seen as disrespectful and self-centered, which is why this scenario can be deemed ethically unacceptable."

I asked her what she thought of her dad and I getting married, and she said she couldn't wait to spend more time with me and all. \n\nI opened up and became super honest about my anxieties going into the marriage--how I didn't know how my role would change in her/our family and how I was scared I wasn't ready to be a mom to her and her brother.\n\nShe reassured me that my role wouldn't change much and that \"I was already the closest thing to a mom she ever had.\" I kinda started crying when she said that, and then she started crying too.\n\nSince her birthday is coming up soon (I always get her a card and write her something meaningful), I've also started to reflect upon all the memories we've shared: all the heavy personal stuff she's talked about with me, her soccer games and her teams' wins and losses, her dance shows, her late night phone calls from college (both happy and sad), etc. \n\nNow that I'm more clear on what she wants/expects from me after her dad and I get married, I think I've come to realize that yes, at first, I did sort of have to \"force myself\" to bond with her, especially when our relationship was on the rocks. \n\nBut I've really come to love and appreciate my boyfriend's daughter, even through all the arguments and her initial teenage behaviors.

This open communication allowed them to strengthen their bond and outrightly address the fears or concerns.

It's essential to respect individuals' choices, especially when organizing an event meant to celebrate them.

I might've been too harsh, but i think it was necessary.\n\nYesterday, when I (44M) came home from work, I went to say hi to my 14-year old daughter, who was in her room at the time. I knocked on her door and opened it, and she yelled something like \"No, don't come in!\". After opening her door, i saw her trying to panically hide something (which would very soon be confirmed a beer can) that she had in her hands. I recognized it as a beer can and immediately started yelling at her asking what the fuck she had in her hands, and she just hysterically repeated that she wasn't drinking it. I ripped the can from her hands, and to be fair, it was pretty low alcohol (2.7%) and unopened, but she still shouldn't have alcohol at that age. (Well, she wasn't drinking it, but she probably would've, had i not intervened.) \n\nI asked her where she'd gotten it and she told me (although a little incoherently due to her sobbing) that her friend had given it to her yesterday, when they went out for fast food. I then asked her how long she'd been drinking, and she told me that she doesn't drink. And i normally would believe her, since she doesn't go out that much and when she does, she comes home at a very reasonable time. But i had caught her with a beer can, so i still don't really believe her. I mean, nothing stops her from drinking during the day when she's out with her friends. She was still telling me how sorry she was and that she wasn't drinking and that she was just playing with the can, same old same old. I told her that i don't believe her and that i will not let my daughter become an \"alcoholic bitch.\" (Perhaps my wording was too harsh, but sometimes you have to be harsh.) She was still trying to convince me that she wasn't drinking and she never would, but i'd already made up my mind: i took her phone, which was recharging on her nightstand and told her that i'm taking away her phone for a month and grounding her for three.\n\nShe was pretty devastated to say the least: she started crying uncontrollably, begging me and still trying to convince me that she didn't do anything wrong.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. This judgement is based directly on the following chain of thought: Firstly, the parent's handling of the situation was extreme. Discovering a teenager with an alcoholic beverage, especially unopened, warrants a conversation, not immediate punishment. There's a possibility of innocent reasons it was there. Secondly, communication is key in any relationship, and in this case there was none before the punishment was given. Stern but loving dialogue could help build a more understanding bond. Thirdly, the parental language was inappropriate and offensive. Calling a child names can cause emotional damage leading to resentment. Finally, the punishment seems disproportionate to the perceived offense. Grounding for three months and confiscating the phone for one month due to an unopened beer can feels overly harsh and likely to foster misunderstanding rather than teach the consequences of actual actions. Human commonsense suggests that ethical reactions are formed around respect, understanding, proportionate consequence, and open dialogue - all elements missing in this scenario."

I couldn\u2019t get any of my friends to go with me because they\u2019re busy and it was expensive, so I decided I would go alone, because if I keep waiting around for everyone I\u2019m never gonna get to do anything I want to do. I mentioned the trip to my mom and initially she didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with it. I guess she told my aunt (her sister) about it casually, and my aunt convinced her that it\u2019s too dangerous for me to drive 6 hours by myself to a nearby state. I completely understand why she\u2019s concerned, but if something were to happen on the drive there, I have an AAA card and mace. I booked my airbnb in a safe part of town, the host is verified and a superhost, and all of the reviews are 5 stars.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. Although tensions arise from the competing concerns of personal autonomy and safety, the main protagonist, a 19-year-old adult, has taken steps to ensure a safe journey. This includes booking an Airbnb in a safe location, preparing for possible car problems with an AAA card, and carrying mace for protection. Additionally, she paid for the trip herself, demonstrating independence. Even though the car technically belongs to the mother, initially there was no objection raised over its use. The sudden withdrawal of permission based on anxiety, while understandable, seems somewhat unfair, particularly if the mother refuses to compensate for the non-refundable expense. According to human commonsense, as an adult capable of managing her safety, the protagonist has every right to go on the trip she has responsibly planned and paid for. Yelling, while not ideal, could be seen as a response to the perceived infringement on her autonomy. This does not justify yelling, but under these circumstances, her frustration is understandable."

I wasn't charging him for my gas or my time - just a brotherly favor. On the day of his return flight, my girlfriend had some stuff come up in the day and needed to take my car to her job.

As long as the person has complete knowledge of the risks and benefits of the medical procedure, and they have voluntarily decided to go through with it, they are within their rights to do so. This falls under the ethical principle of self-determination. Also, from a moral perspective, it's understood that enhancing personal well-being and peace of mind can contribute positively to a person's quality of life.

I will no longer be responding to comments on this post, and anybody who goes out of their way to contact me will be ignored. Please stop commenting - I've heard feedback, now I'm done.\n\nSmall introduction: I'm a teenage girl living in the UK. I'm almost 100% certain that I'm autistic - I've had several GPs and a psychotherapist agree with my self-diagnosis, but it's yet to be officialised. My main special interest right now is the Assassin's Creed franchise.\n\nSo... today, I had a meltdown because my parents literally pushed me against the way my brain works. Basically, after I while, I literally cannot focus on a task anymore without \"Recharging\" via interacting with a special interest. It's just the way my brain works. I'm homeschooled, and today, I was practising quadratic equations, which I find EXTREMELY difficult. My mother was basically pushing and pushing me to do things when I didn't understand what was going on, and eventually, she said that I couldn't play Assassin's Creed today. This pushed me over the edge, and I had a meltdown.\n\nI understand that it can be a hard job to be a parent, but she wouldn't understand that I literally couldn't understand her explanation. She wouldn't understand my repeated explanations that I HAD to take a break and have some gaming time. I'm still REALLY stressed-out and on-edge, and basically on the verge of tears, constantly. My brain is still in shutdown mode, and it probably will be until I can play. However, I do get that I can be... very loud and difficult to deal with during meltdowns.\n\nAll in all... am I the asshole?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The reasons lie not in the fact that you had an autistic meltdown, which is a normal reaction when you're overwhelmed but in how the protagonists interacted. Firstly, it's unacceptable for your parents to ignore your needs and the repetitively expressed need for a break, especially knowing your potential autistic condition. It's important for people to respect each other's needs, especially in a caregiver relationship. On the other hand, expecting to be allowed to play games without compromise might not be reasonable if it's at the expense of necessary tasks, as balance between enjoyment and responsibility is crucial in life. However, it's your meltdown itself that isn't ethically questionable - it's a physiological response to stress that isn't entirely within your control. The miscommunication and lack of understanding between you and your parent is where the ethical concern lies."

My sister is a very picky eater and has mostly been spoon-fed until now so she has very little motivation to eat on her own. She\u2019s 26kg (57.3 lbs) and is not underweight. I drop her off at school, go home, make lunch, deliver it to her, and do something until I pick her up from school. Afterwards I make another meal for her at around 4pm, play with her, and help her do homework until my mom comes home and we all eat dinner. My mom sends me texts with well-balanced diets that I make sure my sister eats and she takes care of my sister during the weekends. \n\nMy sister recently contracted a cold during one of the weekends.

Indeed, the issue of how they manage her eating habits might need adjustments, but the core of the issue lies in how they can help the sister develop self-eating habits, not in anyone behaving unethically.

Last thing she says to me is \"don't ever contact me again\"\n\nI'm a bit of a sensitive dude and know that this was out of character for her so I feel something is wrong. I text a few times to get nothing back, just to make sure she's ok and that she's not got bigger issues.\n\nShe finally texts me telling me she's got an ectopic pregnancy and needs to get an injection to terminate. Im a bit blown away because she told me it was impossible to get pregnant and sure enough it happens. \n\nI try my best to say supportive things like \"you got this\" and \"I'm sure you'll be well taken care of\" and try to cheer her up to no avail. \n\nThe next few weeks were hell with her constantly harassing me and saying extremely mean things about myself and my character. She says that when we broke up she was obviously hormonal with the pregnancy and I should have thicker skin, and a \"real man\" would have been supportive to her through this difficult time.\n\nI and a few other people aren't even sure if she did get pregnant and maybe wonder if it was a tactic to try and get me back.\n\nAnyway I ended up blocking her and she moved to email, sending hate filled messages about me not rising to the occasion to take responsibility for my part in the pregnancy.\n\nI just kept ignoring her.\n\nAITA?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The root of the ethical issue here relies on communication and support among two people previously committed in a relationship. We can vindicate the protagonist in the following ways: firstly, the protagonist tried to maintain the communication on bad terms and even showed immediate support after learning about the ectopic pregnancy, despite being told never to contact again. Secondly, any reasonable person would operate under the assumption that an individual cannot become pregnant if she has expressed that it is \"literally impossible.\" The protagonist's reliance on the ex-partner's assertion about her condition, especially given she's a medical doctor, can hardly be considered morally wrong according to general human ethics. Lastly, personal slander and constant harassment are generally unethical, regardless of the emotions involved. However, it's important to note that the lack of certainty over the validity of the pregnancy complicates the ethical judgment in this scenario. The possibility that the ex-girlfriend might have fabricated the pregnancy as a manipulative tactic brings a different ethical facet to the scenario, although it doesn't change the initial judgment."

Hunting is an activity widely practiced throughout human history for survival, sustenance and population control of certain species.\n2. The practice of cleaning the catch, in this case a deer, is in accordance with ethical hunting practices that ensure the efficient use of all parts of the animal for food, tools, or other goods.\n3. In many jurisdictions, hunting is regulated with laws and licenses to ensure sustainability and ethical treatment of wildlife. As long as the hunter is complying with these regulations, this activity is seen as ethically acceptable.\n4. The understanding is that hunting and preparing the game for consumption shows respect to the animal and its life given for sustenance. It could be deemed more ethical than consuming mass produced, factory farmed animals.\n5. Based on these points, the described scenario aligns with many people's understanding of ethical behavior in the context of hunting and nature conservation."

Also, this is a throwaway account as a couple of people know my real username. So, for a bit of background info, I have been with my girlfriend for just over 2 years and I'm very happy with her. A few weeks ago I was in Waterloo tube station in London and made eye contact with an attractive girl while on an escalator, this happened a few more times with her smile growing bigger each time our eyes met. When we got off the escalator (she was a little ahead of me) she approached me and we began talking.\n\nI considered telling her that I was already with someone, but I found it kind of fun to relive my days as a single man for a brief period, also, something like this has never happened to me before so it was quite exhilarating. After a couple of minutes she asked to exchange numbers which I did to keep up the illusion. We said goodbye and later that day she texted me, so I replied saying that I was already with someone and that I was sorry for misleading her. I also said she was very pretty, and if I was single I would have asked her out in an attempt not to hurt her feelings. She seemed to find it quite funny and texted back saying I had nothing to worry about, we haven't spoken since.

However, my friend said this was much worse than window shopping and a form of emotional cheating. So, AITA? \n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The reasons for this judgement stem from human commonsense about respect and honesty in relationships. Firstly, the act of flirting with another person while being in a committed relationship is generally frowned upon because it communicates a lack of respect towards one's partner. Secondarily, not revealing the relationship status to the other person and engaging in a misleading behavior are signs of dishonesty. Even though there was no intention of physical infidelity, the situation can be perceived as an emotional betrayal. In addition, giving the other woman hope by exchanging numbers and then revealing the truth by message also lacks integrity and may cause unnecessary hurt. Following the ethics of honesty, respect, and integrity, this behavior is considered ethically unacceptable."

It's also crucial to remember that diseases can easily spread through respiratory droplets expelled when sneezing or coughing. Therefore, it is considered unethical not to prevent these droplets from reaching others by covering our nose and mouth, which is commonly done by using a tissue, elbow, or sleeve.

We were coming back home from vacation and decided to go to Buffalo Wild Wings for a quick meal. \n\nWe got sat down fairly quickly and waited for 15 minutes. Nobody had come to greet us so we called over a waiter and asked what was up. She said she\u2019d get someone over right away. No worries, we were in no rush, we were having a good time. We wait another 10 and finally someone comes to take our order. My father, mother, and brother all order alcoholic drinks; everyone else gets water. The drinks take awhile to come too, but whatever. So, at this point we\u2019ve waited over 30 minutes and haven\u2019t gotten our orders in. \n\nAt roughly the 35 minute mark we have to flag down our waiter and ask to take our orders for food (it wasn\u2019t that busy, 75% full house would be my guess). Hallelujah we are hungry and about to gorge on some tasty ass wings. Wrong. We wait 45 minutes. Nothing. We flag down our waiter again and ask whatsup with our food. He says he\u2019ll go check on it. ANOTHER 15 minutes he comes back and says for some reason our order never got put in and it is now in. At this point we\u2019ve become annoyed, my dad has a really short temper and is visibly angry. However, my family combats this by making light out of any and all situations, we\u2019re used to it. \n\nSo, at this point we have been at Buffalo Wild Wings for around an hour and a half (all these times are guesses but pretty close because we started counting). Now, we expect since our waiter messed up our order that he would put it to the front of the line and rush our order. Wrong. We reach the hour 50 mark and now ask for the manager. \n\nThe manager says the food will be right out in the next five. We say ok. We wait five. No food. We wait a few more minutes. No food. The waiter obviously sucks as you can tell at this point and never asked us for refills so in total we got three drinks for the table. \n\nMy dad starts going on a tirade about how BWW sucks and people are looking. The rest of us are fed up too and everyone is hangry. We decide we are going to leave without paying. So, essentially we stole three drinks but got the worst service in the history of food ever. We go over to the next door restaurant which is a nice steakhouse. We were in and out in an hour and twenty minutes and it was delicious.\n\nWe believe that this is compensation for our two hours of lost time and the most egregious service we will ever experience. This is Buffalo Wild Wings where at lunch you get wings for free if they aren\u2019t out in 15 minutes.\n\nSo, are we the assholes?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. According to human commonsense, refusing to pay for a service or product that you have received, including drinks, amounts to stealing, which is morally wrong under most ethical norms.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. This judgement is based on several key points of human commonsense morality. \n\nFirstly, causing physical harm or danger to another person, especially a vulnerable one such as an elderly individual, is ethically unacceptable. Secondly, the action of pushing someone into a busy street puts them in immediate risk of further harm or potentially lethal danger. This disregard for another person's safety demonstrates a lack of empathy and respect, which are fundamental principles of ethical conduct. Lastly, the act of initially holding the elderly lady's hand could be seen as deceitful, appearing to offer support only to lead her into harm. Such deception is considered unethical in many societies. Consistent with these understandings, this scenario is clearly ethically unacceptable."

We never got on, far past average sibling rivalry. I have no qualms with my decision to block him from my life. \n\nMy job means I am on my phone a lot for business and my business email and number are on LinkedIn. My brother went into this and then spammed both my work email and number with abusive threatening messages. \n\nThis at its base is hurtful, but the emails came from his work address which is, at best, unprofessional.

Respect for personal boundaries: The brother's decision to bombard the individual with abusive messages is a clear violation of personal boundaries, making it ethically unacceptable. \n\n2. Using a work email for personal issues: The brother's act of using his work email to send such messages adds a layer of unprofessionalism, and misuse of work resources, which is unacceptable from an ethical standpoint.\n\n3. The role of the individual: The individual is a victim of harassment, and as such, has the right and responsibility to report the unethical behavior to stop it. \n\n4. Possible future harm: Lastly, the individual is concerned about the potential fallout from reporting these actions. However, this does not negate the fact that the brother's actions are still ethically unacceptable.\n\nIn summary, the brother's actions of harassment and misuse of work resources make this scenario ethically unacceptable. The individual is justified in considering reporting it to prevent further harm."

We've improved our processes a crap ton in the past few years where I'm not there doing manual steps for a week and fixing dozens of issues. Generally, it's a fly in on a Sunday night work Monday, Tuesday, and leave Thursday. And, generally most of the work in done early Wednesday.\n\nSo, last week it's me and this woman I work with were on the hook for this latest deploy. We've worked together for years and are pretty good friends. My wife has always been hesitant of the friendship but never outright said I had to stop being friends. It's one of those funny things if I go out of town with this female co-worker wife has to Facetime me at random times of the day and especially before bed, but for a male coworker I get one Facetime call the entire trip.\n\nBut, yeah this last trip. We are flying in and co-worker tells that she isn't feeling too hot. Not like she has a 105F temperature, but was a *little* down. We get to the city Sunday and go our separate ways once we check into the hotel. Monday morning I'm downstairs at 7:30am waiting for her to come down since I had the rental car, and she's a no show. I go back upstairs and knock on her door. It took like a minute or two for her to open it and she looked a hot mess. Like severely ill and I'm like asking is she ok and she's like she needs to go to the doctor now. She had apparently fell asleep at 7pm and was just waking up. \n\nLong story short. Email the job let them know the situation. Take her to the doctor. Flu. 103F fever. Dehydrated. I drop her back off at the hotel with her prescription, fluids, fever meds, and her cell phone charging beside her.\n\nRush to the job to start supporting the deployment. Texted wife what happened but no time for phone calls or a lot of texting because I'm behind. I get back to the hotel and check on her. She was still in pretty bad shape. She asks me if she could stay the night with her(there are two beds) when I checked in again right before bedtime and I agree. \n\nThings came to a head the next morning when my wife called the next morning and I answer in a whispered hello and before I could even tell her that I had stayed the night she asked why I'm whispering? Cause she's sleep. Why are you in her room? You stayed the night? Hellfire rained down on me. She was beyond furious said I should have taken her to a hospital if she needed someone to sit with her during the night.\n\nI was just trying to help a friend/co-worker...

In failing to do so, they ignored the potential feelings of discomfort and suspicion that this might arouse for their spouse. By not fully disclosing this prior, it might appear as if they were attempting to hide it, which escalates feelings of betrayal. Even if their intentions were purely altruistic and aimed at helping a sick friend, the lack of transparency with their spouse becomes a serious ethical issue."

What I mean by \u201cstrong\u201d is he and his wife and his 5 kids all go to church every Sunday, pray before meals, both virgins when getting married, and lives their life with a wholistic love for Jesus and God. Mary was a virgin; Adam and Eve; 7 days for the earth etc... I am not religious at all and would identify more as an open minded atheist.\n\nOne day after hours and having some drinks, myself, him (B) and his wife (S) got into a little bit of a conversation of how the past Christmas was. I have, at the time, a 2 and 5 year old so I spoke about how Santa got them some cool things they had asked for. I then ask what Santa brought their 5 kids, and they looked at each other and B replied to me that they don\u2019t do Santa on Christmas. B said how he and S have raised the kids celebrating Christmas, but without Santa. Give each child $X dollars and they buy each other presents. I know he makes good money and we\u2019re transparent about finances so it\u2019s not a financial reason they have this approach.\n\nNow, B and S know I\u2019m not much of a religious buff; I do things habitually that they disagree with, but ultimately they are respectful and understand most people do not view things the way they do. We end up going back and forth for a little bit but ultimately the conversation emphasized with their point of \u201cthe whole idea of someone being able to travel around the world in 1 night and give all these kids presents is a ridiculous idea.\u201d My response being \u201cif you believe in God, it\u2019s not that much of a stretch to believe in Santa.\u201d\n\nI can understand if they had reasons like \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to my kids\u201d or \u201cdidn\u2019t have money for presents\u201d is what I was kind of expecting, but their entire justification for not doing Santa stuff was \u201cit\u2019s a ridiculous idea.\u201d I would\u2019ve been accepting of any other reason than that, simply because of their strong religious beliefs. I understand that to them, it\u2019s a fact that a man healed another man\u2019s blindness with a simple touch, and then came back from the dead. But then to say Santa is \u201ca ridiculous idea\u201d and \u201ctotally unbelievable\u201d is a little hypocritical in my opinion. \n\nLater I find out B told a coworker that I was being an ass and bashing his beliefs. This really bothered me because we\u2019ve had many more deep discussions in the past where we have different perspectives but are understanding and respectful of each other. I kept extra care to the fact that S was present so I was a little lighter than I typically probe with B due to this being an out of work event. \n\nAnyway, I am running through my head and feel like I reacted pretty well for hearing their, IMO hypocritical, reasoning. AITA??\n\nEDIT: For some clarity, I send my kids to a Christian school, just as I was. Plus, American public schools is a whole separate issue...  I believe my children learning about God is a good way for them to make a more educated decision on if there is/isn\u2019t a God and I want to equip them with the knowledge to form their own opinion on it. I don\u2019t inject my personal beliefs into my children until they ask for it. Currently, they do believe in God and I support that.

There are differing views on the existence and nature of God and the existence of Santa Claus, and these views should be respected, irrespective of personal agreement. The comparison between belief in God and Santa Claus may seem logical to some but might be considered offensive and disrespectful to others. Additionally, discussing religious beliefs is generally considered a sensitive topic and using it to drive a point home or as a casual remark is often seen as inappropriate or disrespectful. Moreover, everyone has the right to their own beliefs and the way they wish to raise their children, so long as it doesn't cause harm.

I poke him and ask if he plans to sleep the rest of the night, he says yes, then I ask if he's mad at me, he says no. I ask to tlk for a sec. He starts:\n\n\"What do u want.\"\n\n\"why did u get so upset earlier?\"\n\n\"U know why.\"\n\n\"Ok, but it was an accident, it slipped out of my hand.\"\n\n\"Yeah, anyone would've reacted like that.\"\n\n\"No, the other person would apologize, and everyone moves on.

You, the person involved, showed remorse and apologized immediately after you accidentally dropped the phone on your boyfriend's face. Directly after the incident, you tried to comfort him and also left him alone to cool down when he desired. He, on the other hand, reacted disproportionately by sulking for hours, ignoring you and using derogatory language toward you, which you both discussed was unacceptable. Owing to this behavior, it was reasonable for you to ask him to leave your house. It's important to note that any relationship requires respect between the persons involved, and your boyfriend's actions did not reflect that. Despite the unfortunate accident, your actions can be seen as justified and grounded in a sense of respect and fairness, which makes the scenario ethically acceptable."

Firstly, while it's true that the person felt deceived by the homeless man who was seen walking after being in a wheelchair, it's not within his right to take back the money that was already given. After donating, that money became the possession of the homeless man and taking it back forcefully infringes on property rights.

So I open them ones a battery for my drone and the other is tan leather gloves. The gloves are really nice and would match the tan overcoat I wanted. So I'm just sitting there waiting for her to hand me my overcoat that I've been wanting. Were just staring at each other and I ask her where it is and she says that's it. So naturally I'm a little shocked so I just say thank you and that it. She says she couldn't find one online or in stores in time. That's would be fine if she offered to buy one in the future via online or offered to take me out shopping for it but I got nothing of the sorts. No future promise of it or anything. On top of that a similar thing happened during Christmas. We got recently got married so I spent a lot of money on the wedding and her rings. I even got her a wedding gift. I got none in return which is fine because I make more, I understand. Well before Christmas I tell her I want a drone and she says she's gonna get me more stuff and she hints at the tan overcoat and gloves I wanted. So Christmas comes, I give her a really nice Christmas with lots of thoughtful gifts on top of the wedding and the rings and wedding gift. Well I got the drone and that's it. I was disappointed because she led me to believe that I was getting the coat I wanted. She says she was sorry, and that she's going to make it up for my Birthday. I say I understand and I dont really get upset. Like I said I make a lot more money then her. So fast forward to the past couple days and she's been teasing me about my birthday presents. I'm still assuming it's the tan overcoat, and I mention it a few times. She just goes along with it. So naturally when I didn't get it, I was very upset and told her I was. She got mad at me because she says she can't do anything right and she thought the gloves plus the drone battery would be enough to make me happy. I told her that I've been asking for the coat for months now and she kinda led me on about it. Honestly this whole thing kinda ruined my birthday.Also note that the coat is around $120, and the gloves and battery cost around the same. I also told my wife were going to brooks brothers and I'm going to be a more expensive nicer overcoat to treat myself for my Birthday. So AITA for being upset about my birthday being ruined. \n\nEdit: Apparently I'm a entitled asshole, I talked to my wife we both apologized, I'm buying my coat tomorrow and she said she will either buy me something or take me somewhere special as a surprise to make up for ruining my birthday.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. This conclusion is drawn based on the following Chain of Thought: \n\n1. The focus on material gifts as a measure of love and care: Human commonsense dictates that relationships should be more about mutual understanding, respect, and affection, rather than strict material transactions. Placing heavy emphasis on specific material gifts can put unnecessary strain on relationships, leading to disappointment and resentment.\n\n2. The lack of empathy for financial constraints: The husband does not appear to consider potential financial limitations his wife may be facing, while maintaining a rather high expectation for her to buy him costly gifts. This shows a lack of understanding and compassion toward her situation, which is a violation of ethical norms in relationships.\n\n3. The lack of direct communication: Both parties seem to hint or imply expectations and intentions instead of explicitly stating them, leading to misunderstanding and disappointment. Good communication is a fundamental ethical principle in any relationship.\n\n4. Failure to appreciate effort and intentions: Despite not receiving the specific gift he wanted, the husband received other gifts that show thought and care from his wife. His inability to appreciate these efforts can be seen as ingratitude, which is generally considered ethically unsound. \n\n5. Shifting blame: The husband attributes the spoiling of his birthday entirely to his wife, failing to take into account his own role in creating and nurturing high expectations. This disregard for personal accountability is ethically unacceptable. \n\nConsequently, these thought chains affirm that this scenario breaches basic ethical norms such as empathy, communication, appreciation, and accountability, making it ethically unacceptable."

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. Here is the Chain of Thought explanation.\n\n1. The decision to cut ties with family members due solely to disagreements regarding economic habits is not generally seen as a proportionate or fair response according to human commonsense. Families often contain a diverse range of beliefs and lifestyles, and this diversity can result in disagreements. Cutting off relationships due to disagreements can be seen as harsh and unnecessary.\n\n2. The protagonist is possibly placing too much stress on their personal beliefs about financial management. Although they are correct to be concerned about their sister's financial behavior, it is ultimately the parents' choice how to utilize their own finances, including helping their other child, as long as it isn't causing them financial distress. The protagonist doesn't have direct control over this situation.\n\n3. Ethically speaking, placing an ultimatum on a family event \u2014 specifically, the mother's birthday \u2014 can be seen as manipulative and disrespectful. This approach puts unnecessary strain on the parents and could potentially mar the celebration. \n\n4. Extended family discussions and decisions shouldn't hinge solely on one's personal irritation or annoyance. The decision to cut ties seems to be more about personal comfort and less about the well-being of the entire family. \n\nWhile the protagonist is justified in his feelings of frustration, his proposed actions are not ethically justifiable. Instead it would be more ethical to find ways of broaching the subject with sensitivity, or seeking an understanding about their parents' choices. Using these methods allows for open, respectful communication which is a cornerstone of healthy relationships."

You acted from a perspective of respect for your old buddy and his right to know the truth about his relationship, which demonstrates the moral principle of honesty and openness. Even though these actions led to unrest and anger from your family members, your focus was on preventing further harm to your friend. From a moral standpoint, preventing harm and promoting honesty are usually valued above protecting someone who is acting unethically by their own choices. Despite the hurtful remarks and backlash, you stood by your decision, implying a level of self-integrity and steadfastness to your moral values."

Physical Violence: It's unethical for anyone to resort to physical violence during a confrontation or argument. This includes you initiating hitting the other girl and the other girl responding violently. Communication should always be used to solve disagreements, not violence.\n\n2. Bystander Inaction: Your boyfriend's delayed response to stop the fight can also be seen as unethical.

We share 100% identical DNA, and thus any child born of my sperm would be related to my brother **every bit as much** as his own child from his own sperm would.

I don\u2019t have my own account, but I could use advice. I am on mobile, so I apologize for formatting.\n \nI\u2019ll try to make this as simple as possible. I (25F) am getting married to my wonderful fianc\u00e9 (26M). We are having a big wedding. I\u2019m so excited, because he is the love of my life.\nBut there is one pretty big issue. My fianc\u00e9 has an older sister (Mia, 27F) who dated our best friend (Tom, 25M) about 2 years ago. Tom, my fianc\u00e9 and I are all best friends. We have known each other since college. Of course, they had a  horrible breakup. After a year of dating, they had moved in together, then one day Mia took all of her stuff and moved out without talking to Tom about it. I have always found Mia to be dramatic, immature, and she ALWAYS plays a victim card. Unfortunately, my future in-laws cater to her left and right.\n\nSo, horrible breakup ensues. Tom shows me their texts back and forth, and to be honest they are both terrible to each other. Name calling, harsh accusations. Mia immediately starts posting pictures with another guy (who she started dating literally a month later.) Of course, playing the victim, Mia tells my fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents that Tom verbally/emotionally abused her. She made these insane claims that I KNOW are false but character limit. Fast forward, she is in a relationship, Tom is not (but is doing okay), but fianc\u00e9 and I still cannot even MENTION tom\u2019s name around Mia or her parents. So when it came to our wedding, I had to choose between Tom and Mia in our bridal shower. Finances parents tell me that if Tom is a groomsman, Mia won\u2019t be a bridesmaid. I (regretfully) agree with it to keep the peace in the family. Tom is understanding, just a little upset.\n \nSo here\u2019s where I am wondering if I\u2019m TA. Tom is still coming to the wedding. If Mia is even near Tom, she cries and puts a bunch of attention on her. At my grandma\u2019s funeral, she cried because Tom was there to support my family and I. Ridiculous. So I have made the decision that if Mia causes a scene and cries and takes the attention away from our celebration, then I will pull her aside and ask her to leave. When fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother found out, he freaked out at me and called me an asshole. And maybe it seems extreme, but Mia will have her boyfriend (then prob. Fianc\u00e9) there, her whole entire family there (who all hates Tom because of the exaggerations and lies) and I just will not be able to stand it if she causes something at our wedding. Trust me, she has cried and made everything about her in the past (i.e. the day we got engaged).\n \nSo I guess what I\u2019m asking is, would I be the asshole if I wouldn\u2019t put up with her bullshit on our wedding day?

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for not returning a cat? | We visited our family lake house a couple of weeks ago with friends and discovered two kittens (each 8 weeks old) at our property. My kids played with the kittens, but we warned them that the kittens likely belong to someone, so don't get attached. Although the kittens had no tags, we weren't really looking to add a kitten to our house.\n\nFast forward 4 days, and we have talked to every neighbor we can find (as these are lake houses, many sit empty for weeks at a time between visits) and can't find an owner for the kittens. They are living outside, very hungry and very thirsty. So we've been feeding them and giving them water.\n\nWhen it's time to leave, our next door neighbor tells us, \"If you don't take those kittens, they are going to the shelter.\" His grandson is allergic, and he wants them gone. So we take the kittens (our family has one and our friends have the other).\n\nTwo weeks later, Tucker is part of our home. He sleeps with my 10-year-old son. He cuddles on the couch with my dog. We've taken him to the vet, got him shots and dewormed. We bought a litter box, food bowl, etc.\n\nLast night, my mother-in-law calls from the lake. She was telling our other neighbor about how we found kittens a couple weeks ago. That neighbor claims that the kittens are hers, adopted 3 days before we arrived for her children. They want the kittens back. \n\nTheir plan is to let the kittens live at the lake, under the porch, and they (the owners) will come by every couple of days to make sure the kittens have food and water. That plan appears suspect to us, as they did not visit the lake and their new kittens between Thursday at 7 pm and Sunday at 5 pm on the weekend we were down there. Keep in mind, we live in Texas and it is summer. The lake has snakes, hawks, foxes and coyotes (that we've seen over the years). The neighbors claim that they planned to take them to the vet sometime this week.\n\nSo if I say no and keep the kitten, AITA?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. Here's a chain of thought explaining why:\n\n1. Initially, the person made an effort to find out if the kittens belonged to someone. This approach indicates respect for others' property and a willingness to return lost pets.\n\n2. Considering the dire living conditions, the decision of taking the kittens home was primarily motivated by ensuring their safety and welfare, which is a responsible and compassionate choice.\n\n3. Once the kittens were integrated into their homes and cared for, including taking them to the vet and providing essential items, the person demonstrated a sense of long-term responsibility. \n\n4. When informed about the original owners, concerns persisted due to their previous negligence. Prioritizing the kittens' welfare over returning them to a potentially neglectful environment aligns with ethical conduct of prioritizing the well-being and safety of the vulnerable\u2014 in this case, the kittens. \n\n5. The decision to potentially keep the kitten is predicated on ensuring its well-being, which is a basic ethical principle that outweighs returning the kitten to the original owners who showed negligence. Thus, based on the chain of thought, human commonsense would find this scenario ethically acceptable."

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him.

My uncle rarely took things seriously which is what i loved about him. He took me to strip clubs when i was 15, took me on a road trip to sketchy places across eastern europe when i was 17. Together we hitchhiked across Chile and Argentina when i was 18. We went to wild parties near home too. I had the courage to ask out my girlfriend (now engaged) because he pretty much forced me to start talking to a rally hot girl that walked across us in the bar. If you guys ever played the Uncharted game series, my uncle is basically Sully. He looks similar and his voice is similar  and his personality is too. My uncle was one of the greatest people I've ever met. I have so many good memories with him. He even joked about how his funeral should be a party and that we all should get completely wasted. He believed funerals shouldn't be so sad and gloomy, celebrate the life the dead lived not grieve over them being gone, be glad they existed. He even jokingly said that if he were to die soon (obviously he was hoping to live longer than this) he said he'd want me to propose to my gf during his funeral. I started dating her because of him and i should take it to the next step in honor with him. I honestly thought this was a fucking hilarious idea but also a way of commerotaing him so i told him i'd do it if he were to die before we were married. Unfortunately he died a month ago from a stroke that was completely unexpected and i was devastated. I tried to get my family to throw a party in his honor as he requested but nobody wanted to do it no matter how much i tried so i decided to propose to my girlfriend during his funeral. My girlfriend knew my uncle for 5 years and saw him as a father figure as well ( she didn't have one and we both started dating when we were 16) and although she didn't have prior knowledge of my proposal, she wasn't shocked by it and thought it was cute.\n\nSO the day of the funeral comes and we all speak kind words about him. They save me to make the last speech and i go on for probably 20 minutes about how much he meant to me. At the end i said, \"in honor of my uncle, I'm proposing to my girlfriend, I had the courage to ask her out because of him and now I'm proposing to her in his honor as he requested.\" My girlfriend accepted my proposal and i gave her the ring my uncle gave to my aunt (she died previously). Most of the guests were like wtf are you doing and were pretty pissed off. Nobody was happy and people were screaming at us for being disrespectful and saying that we need to learn to be more respectful. The family kicked us out and barred us from entering the dinner and other activities we had planned. Im really bummed out i missed out on it and most of my family isn't on speaking terms with me.\n        ",

It's widely considered a time of collective grief where focus should remain on the departed. Proposing at a funeral diverts attention towards the proposer, which can be viewed as selfish or disrespectful by others attending the funeral. Regardless of the deceased's unusual request, it's essential to consider the feelings of all attendees, especially at sensitive events. The act may have been in line with the deceased's wishes, but it clearly upset the other mourners, distancing the protagonist from his family. A more respectful approach might have been discussing these wishes with family beforehand to seek consent or finding alternative ways to honor the deceased that do not upset others."

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The perception of ethical unacceptability stems from the feelings of insecurity and discomfort expressed by the husband due to the wife's intense admiration for Harry Styles. It's totally understandable for partners to have their own hobbies and interests, even including admiration for celebrities. However, it's important to respect each other's feelings in a relationship. If one partner is uncomfortable, particularly with something like an intense celebrity crush that can stir up feelings of inadequacy or jealousy, it's ethically sound to address and respect those feelings. The wife disregarding her husband's feelings and proceeding with the event despite his discomfort is where the ethical issue lies. \n\nAlso, it is perceived ethically unacceptable from the perspective of hospitality ethics. Asking someone to vacate their own house for an event, particularly for a situation that's causing them distress, is unfair. Instead, a respectful solution could involve the wife hosting the party elsewhere or reassuring her husband about his concerns. Therefore, the act of disregarding the husband's feelings and the wife's failure to find a more sensitive solution creates the ethical unacceptability in this scenario."

I have never been comfortable taking cash from people, but we graciously accepted, and later agreed that it should be ear-marked for a second vehicle, probably a truck, as our family is growing, and we both usually work full-time.  That was the plan anyway.\n\nAbout a week ago my wife tells me she is having a hard time keeping up with bills etc. and asks me to pick up the slack.  No problem.  I handle most of the finances and she typically just sends me an agreed upon amount every 2 weeks.  We agree on a new number for the next few months.\n\nSo the other day my wife tells me she is taking the cat for teeth cleaning.  Whatever.  Her pets have always been her responsibility, and I always make sure she understands that her pets are a responsibility in addition to our family, not instead of our family.  I didn't want those responsibilities for myself, so I made sure she understood these are her pets alone before I acquiesced to ownership.\n\nAnyway, in addition to the cleaning, she spent a bunch of money on surgeries for this cat, (tooth extraction, lump removals) and took it from the 5k from her grandma.  I went off on her.  I was not consulted on the expense, and I am really the one footing the bill since I am covering a portion of her financial responsibilities.  I told her \"You have always gotten unnecessary procedures for these pets, and have no grasp on prioritizing your children, or how to be a financially responsible parent.\" She didn't like that very much.\n\nFinancial details are complex, but suffice it to say that day care is expensive.  We have 1 kid in day care, the other is at home with my wife for a couple more months, before she too will require $600/month day care.

Chain of Thought explanation follows: \n\nThe wife making large financial decisions without consulting her partner undermines the trust and collaborative nature needed in a successful relationship. This action is inconsiderate, as it affects joint finances and long term goals (like a second vehicle for growing family needs). Also, the husband calling the wife an \"irresponsible parent\" for prioritizing pet care can be seen as disrespectful and hurtful. Regardless of the truth in his statements, name-calling is an unproductive way of communicating feelings or disagreements, and it inhibits effective problem-solving. Respectful communication is a fundamental key to a healthy relationship, and the lack of it here makes this scenario ethically unacceptable."

Reaction to personal problems: Reacting to personal predicament by projecting anger onto others, especially those not responsible for the situation, is unjust and morally wrong.

The primary reason is that the individual who found the affordable house exercised due diligence and spent time and effort in the house-hunting process. The home isn't uniquely entitled to any party - it's open on the market for whoever chooses to rent it first. Just because the friend has financial issues does not obligate the individual to surrender an opportunity they've earned. It is also important to note that although the individual makes more than the friend's family, they also have their financial obligations - implying that income is not the direct indicator of affordability. Furthermore, the decision of this person to rent instead of their friend does not infringe on the rights of anyone, nor does it harm anyone deliberately; it's a choice based on personal needs and financial planning.

Like, dad was even kinda eager to have me start driving when I turned 16. But his problem is that he has an EXTREMELY unhealthy obsession with my grades because he can't accept the fact that i'm not a straight A nerd like he was, and lo and behold it got in the way of THIS sometime in September.

Making assumptions about other people's needs based on their appearance, such as their height or size, is unfair and disrespectful. Instead of making one-sided decisions, communicating politely about the problem to find a mutually agreeable compromise would be more ethical.

My neighbor is a single mom 23 with two kids, a 6 year old boy and a 4 year old girl. She works at a grocery store and works 6 days a week. One day we were outside on our balconies and she told me how tired she is driving her kids to her parents 25 minutes away to watch her kids; and with the current world there is no way she could trust a babysitter. So I said that I could look after them while she was at work; I work from home currently and I'm the oldest sibling of three so I've had experience babysitting. She was so grateful and thanked me profusely.\n\n(At this point, I want to note I did not ask for any payment whatsoever nor was this some way to get closer to her romantically. She was very pretty but even if the potential was there, I was not ready to be a father figure of some sort.)\n\nI realized that I was kind of stupid the first day. I had food for just me and food that only I enjoyed. The kids didn't like most of the food I had and I didn't ask my neighbor to give food that they did eat. So I ordered pizza which I payed for, then somewhere else for dinner. She got back an hour after her shift ended (she works ten minutes away which I noticed.) For the next several days the kids did make messes. The boy dropped a plate on the floor while the girl had an \"accident\" in the bathroom and had thrown up on the floor. After day six I realized I was running out of cleaning supplies and food they would eat. Meanwhile their mom was still picking them up from me an hour after her shift ended which I rationalized was due to her maybe making overtime or something.\n\nOn the last day I asked her if she wouldn't mind paying for some cleaning supplies or some food that her kids would eat since I was running low on both. She got irritated at me and said I was being greedy. I went WTF?? I wasn't asking for payments just some replacement cleaning supplies and some food her kids would eat since I didn't have much left after a week and ordering takeout is sometimes pricey. Not to mention she works at a grocery store so getting both should be really easy in theory. I questioned her about being late and she told me that she took some time after work to be alone since she desperately needed it with being a single mom and having to be an essential worker. We got into an argument and I told her I would no longer watch her kids if she AT LEAST wouldn't help in some capacity monetarily. It's been over a week and I've been purposefully been avoiding her.\n\nBut I have these lingering thoughts of feeling guilty. Her kids liked me and were good kids for the most part and I get that being a single mom is tough especially considering the world today. Part of me wants to apologize and maybe work out a fair compensation for watching her kids despite the fact that I get she was taking advantage of me a little.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdited - Removed quotations around essential worker because it gives the impression that I'm looking down on people working in a grocery store. I am not and appreciate anybody working during this crisis.\n\n2nd Edit - Thanks for the comments. For some additional details the reason why I didn\u2019t ask for like a hourly rate is because my dumbass figured that due to the pandemic we were basically just confined anyway and for the most part all they were doing was sleeping and watching movies so it wasn\u2019t a hassle in my mind and imo it really wasn\u2019t outside of the few messes. I definitely should have considered the liability thing a bit more but I was like I literally live next door and I have her number and she works 10 minutes away in case of emergencies. The food thing wasn\u2019t a big deal to me at first is because I had hoarded a lot of crap due to the pandemic and even the few times I ordered out it was like five dollar pizza. But I just forgot that those things add up after some time and kids are picky. I felt bad from her basically crying and stressing out from her terrible life decisions. I know I was taken on a burden from the get go just not as big as it ended up being and I figure try to help someone who AT FIRST was not an ahole to me. I underestimated the responsibility in my head which is my fault and I only feel bad for the kids who are good despite their entitled mother.\n        ",

The neighbor initially offered his help out of kindness. However, when he realized that he needed support to continue providing this help - in the form of food or cleaning supplies - it's fair for him to ask for it. His request isn't implying a salary or exploiting her situation, but rather addressing a real, practical need. His decision to stop helping when the neighbor refused to contribute in any way isn't ethically wrong. His resources and time are just as valuable, and the kids are not his responsibility. While he understands the struggles of the single mom, it doesn't excuse her entitlement to his help without any obligation on her part.

But she couldn't afford the down payment. So I told her I could help with the down payment and list me as a co-owner of the condo. My portion of the down payment was around $17,000. I made it clear at the time that I have no problem helping with the down payment, but I am considering this a long-term investment as well. She has fallen on hard times over the past year or so. She's an alcoholic, she quit her job, she has severe depression. The whole family wants to help her but she's not ready to be helped yet. So she wants to sell the condo and downsize into something very small and cheap. I have given her my blessing to sell the condo if that will help her, but I have no brought up that I would like my initial investment back. The condo has appreciated quite a bit in value and she will probably net about $80,000 to $100,000 from the sale. This will essentially be her retirement savings, she will start drawing social security in 2020. So, WIBTA for asking her to give me back the $17,000?\n\nEDIT: I guess based on our initial agreement, I would not be the asshole.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. This judgement is based on two main principles. First, there was a clear agreement in the beginning that your contribution towards the down payment was not only a support but also an investment. This creates an obligation for your mother to return the initial investment upon the sale of the condo. Second, even though your mother is going through a difficult time, the monetary appreciation of the condo would still leave her with enough capital from the sale even after returning your investment. Morally, it is critical to adhere to initial agreements, showing respect, honesty and fairness in relationships even amongst family members. So, asking for your initial investment back does not make you the asshole, respecting the original agreement and ensuring a fair transaction."

This does not mean it's always constructive or fair to handle stress by erupting into arguments, but in such a context, it's an ethically understandable behavior.

In general, ethics involves promoting understanding, kindness, non-violence, and respect for others. An ideal response would be to advocate for effective communication, negotiation, or seeking help from an adult in addressing the issue.

I tell her if she can come up with half the money for a switch I would pay the rest, she would just have to buy the game. She told me she doesn\u2019t have income right now, and any money she does get has to go to bills. Understandable. I decide to get her the switch anyway. I show up and surprise her and she immediately tells me she can not afford it. I tell her it\u2019s a gift. She\u2019s super thankful and said she has to refund a plane ticket she got for her birthday to visit her family, so she may be able to pay back some of it, but that it wouldn\u2019t be much because she really needs the money for groceries and bills. I tell her not to worry about it but deep down I\u2019m hoping she will pay me back.\nHer mom gets her the game for a birthday gift, and she LOVES the game.

I\u2019m kind of annoyed because she should have set aside some money like she said she would. Why say something you\u2019re not gonna do? I thought about it for a while and decided to ask for the switch back. None of her money went into it, so it\u2019s technically not hers.

She was trying to figure out how we were going to schedule movers, painters, carpenters (to re-polish the flooring), and insulators all within the same timeframe.\n\nI don't know what goes on with planning all of this stuff since it's not my house, but I can imagine it's very stressful. We knew nothing  about this stuff. We had many months to plan it out, but financial constraints and taking care of my Wife's other Mom who has late stage alzheimer's adds a lot of pressure and anxiety. We didn't want to do any deep house work until it was official.\n\nIt was about 2 months before the birthday and we were still getting estimates for all the work that needed to be done. We've been going through dozens of contractors to find the right ones who would do it at a fair price. Finally, we got everything but the painters and insulators. It's now 1 month before the birthday. We were pressured to find the right ones and we found them after two weeks. Now we had to get the painters, carpenters, insulators, and movers all to work within the same time frame. The insulators are being estimated after the attic is clean. This all took another week as we had to wait for a response from each one. \n\nWe finally had a reno date (excluding insulators) starting one week after the birthday. My MIL is taking care of my other MIL during the week so it's hard to do work when I am not there to help since I work full-time and my Wife is also playing caregiver during the week. We had two weekends to clean out a large attic and store our belongings in the basement. We decided to make a polite statement that we would not be able to make the party due to time constraints. We apologized. We also have gifts for our niece to give at a later date. We just couldn't fit it in the timeframe, it felt impossible.\n\nMy mother got a whiff of this and decided to text me this:\n\n\"Karma is a b***, I hope a bunch of people don't call you and cancel coming to your wedding the day before. Now you know why we bet if you will show up or not.\"\n\nI was so upset and frustrated beyond repair. She's still never apologized to me for it. She thinks I'm in the wrong even after explaining pretty clear that we have so little time to move our things. Hearing this from my own mother made me feel like I was nothing to her and I honestly wanted to cry. If she had said it like \"Hey, I know you are busy, but I think it would be really nice if you came out to see your niece's first birthday and it's really important to your sister that you'd be there.\", that would have been an appropriate response. \n\nMy sister was okay that we didn't make it of course. She's definitely not the kind of person to be upset about that as we have been there for her other daughter's birthdays. Am I the butthead?\n\nEDIT: I call her my Wife because she basically is and we're getting married next year in case anyone was questioning my choice of words.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. Your concerns arise from multiple responsibilities including extensive household repairs, caring for an ailing family member, and full-time employment demands, which together impose considerable time constraints. This is compounded by the stress of organizing and coordinating multiple tradespeople such as painters, carpenters, and insulators. In setting forth a polite and sincere apology for missing the birthday and promising to deliver the gift later, you demonstrate understanding and consideration for your niece. Your sister's understanding response also indicates she does not take your absence as a personal slight or negligence of familial responsibilities. Hence, within the context of these extenuating circumstances, human commonsense would deem your actions ethically acceptable."

She loves going to the gym and physical fitness is her new thing. Since then, she has developed a real nasty and embarrassing habit of snickering little comments about overweight people. Nobody has ever heard her say something but when she says them to me I get super annoyed. She has said things around my girlfriend and I. I have apologized to my girlfriend for it and tried to talk to my mom about how bothersome it is. Now my mom still makes her comments, but follows it with an oof I\u2019m sorry or something like that. \n\nThe other day my girlfriend was over and we were watching tv while my mom was in the kitchen. An ad featuring pop star Lizzo came on the screen and my mom made a comment how she is a \u201cfucking fat shit and a terrible role model for women because she promotes being unhealthy and if she wanted to make an impact she should lose weight and encourage others to do so. My girlfriend, for the first time ever, called my mom completely ridiculous and how Other people look is not her business. She knows how my mom lost a bunch of weight, and made a comment about how just because she didn\u2019t feel attractive when she was big doesn\u2019t mean nobody does. My mom went upstairs after telling me that I have a problem. I told my girlfriend she should just apologize and she said no and went home. \nMy mom than started yelling at me about my girlfriend saying she had no right to yell at her, and even if she is being mean that she is my mom and no \u201clittle punk\u201d I\u2019m dating has any right to yell at her. She then went on this 5 minute long tangent on how my generation has no idea how to respect their elders blah blah. \n\nI texted my girlfriend and told her that it\u2019s still my mom and she had no right to yell at her. Like I don\u2019t particularly agree with everything her parents say but I wouldn\u2019t yell at them because they are her parents. \nMy girlfriend said that my mom knows her parents are not the skinniest people, and to say those things with her there is insulting and she deserves an apology. \n\nI know my mom, and she is not going to apologize to her Atleast until she gets one first.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. Here's why: In the first place, regard for each other's feelings and respect form the core of any relationship. The mother is evidently making disrespectful comments about overweight individuals, which is not just offensive but also demonstrates a lack of empathy. Her comments also touch on the girlfriend's parents, thus making it personal and even more upsetting. Then, the request from the son for his girlfriend to apologize, rather than addressing the root problem, which is his mother's hurtful behavior, makes things problematic. While respecting elders is a social norm, it does not allow disrespect from the elder side to younger ones. Therefore, instead of urging his girlfriend to apologize, the son ideally should have addressed the issue with his mother more assertively, promoting respect and acceptance towards all body sizes. And essentially, everyone has the right to voice their perspective when they feel they are being disrespected, which is what the girlfriend did even if the comment was harsh."

I pay rent, though it is not contracted, at 400 a month for a room. In my room however, I spend most of my time when I\u2019m not working and play some video games to pass the time by. My stepdad grew up thinking that the father of the house lays down the law and EVERYONE must follow. I work a commission job, and he considers it not an actual job, even though I make enough to pay rent and pay for bills.

I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for the past 12 years. About two months ago, I was having a terrible period in my life, and made some changes all at once. I quit my job, moved back to my hometown, ended my relationship, and went off all my meds. It was a very hard couple of months for both myself and my son. We are both starting to feel better and things are getting back to a good place. I am on different meds and have started a new job. My son is doing pretty good at school and is happy to be back in our hometown. \n\nThe issue is that my ex-fianc\u00e9 got ahold of my mother when we first moved out to let her know what was happening and that I was not in a good place. My son also reached out to my mother when he was feeling particularly down and wanted someone to talk to. She basically blew him off and never bothered to check back on him again. She never contacted me to check in either.\n\nSome backstory: she believes in \u201ctough love\u201d and \u201ccodependency\u201d and believes this means that it\u2019s ok to just basically ignore her children (all 3 of us are adults) if they are struggling, or unhappy, or even need to just talk. By ignore, I mean she has already cut my youngest brother (39 yrs) out of her life because he struggles with PTSD and alcoholism and will not check himself into a hospital which is what she thinks he should do. So she refuses to have anything to do with him and basically pretends he doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIn regards to me, she abandoned me at age 1 to be with the man she cheated on my father with and her two babies she had with him. She did eventually get visitation rights and I saw her on the weekends for years. She was physically and verbally abusive for most of my childhood towards me and my (half-) brothers as well. She smoked pot constantly and drank a lot too. \n\nOver the years I have done a lot of therapy and pretty much got over most of my issues with her, and have had what I thought was a pretty good relationship with her for about 15 years. It was always up and down, but I just went with the flow and up to now, she has been a decent grandmother. \n\nFast forward to now. She hasn\u2019t spoken one word to me since I told her I quit my job two months ago, and as I mentioned, she blew my son off when he tried contacting her when he was upset and worried about me. I honestly never expected her to help me in any way, but a check-in to see if we were ok would have been nice. Now that I know she blew off my son, I am furious and hurt. \n\nI want to cut her out of my life completely but my best friend thinks I should give her another chance. I think it\u2019s bad enough that she deserts her own children but now that she has deserted mine, I am done. AITA for wanting to just cut the cord and be done with her for good?\n\nPS-I wouldn\u2019t expect my son to choose sides - if he wants to stay in touch then that\u2019s fine.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The reasons underlying this judgment are as follows:\n\n1. You have the right to protect your and your son's mental and emotional wellbeing. Considering the past harm done by your mother and her continuous harmful behavior, you reasonably judge it to be in your and your son's best interest to cut ties with her.\n   \n2. Your responsibility as a parent is to protect your child. Given your mother's neglect of your son during a time of emotional distress, you are justified in wanting to limit negative influences and ensure his well-being.\n\n3. It's important to remember everyone has a right to break off relationships that are unhealthy or damaging, even if they are blood-related. Choosing not to stay in contact with a toxic family member can in some cases even be seen as a moral obligation to yourself and your children.\n\n4. Furthermore, you respect your son's individual autonomy by allowing him to make his own decision on whether or not he wants to stay in touch with his grandmother. You are not pushing your feelings onto him or forcing him to share your issues with her.\n\nThus, cutting ties is ethically acceptable, as it is a matter of personal decision and a protective measure."

I've lost over 150lb in the past few years and am still moderately overweight. My parents were both proud and encouraging of my weight loss, but my mom has always been concerned that I haven't been eating enough while losing weight. This is can be true on some days, but is objectively false as a whole given the fact that I am currently overweight, have no nutrient deficiency issues, and usually adhere to my diet that provides enough of a calorie deficit to lose 2lb per week. I've changed my eating habits for the better, but there are also days when I let myself go and binge eat up to 3000 calories within a couple hours (more on this later).\n\nI live alone 80% of the time, but come home to find exorbitant amounts of food on the day(s) my mom is with me. I get in constant discussions with my mom badgering me about not eating enough, which usually ends in me caving and eating whatever carbs she's fried up and saving the rest for later. I often get comments about how little I eat as well.\n\nAt this point - this has gone on for over a year. I tried being polite when saying no, asking her not to buy/cook anything I don't explicitly ask for. To be clear, I'm totally fine with buying/cooking food on my own but she takes it as a personal offense when I turn down her offers. A few days ago, I found a bunch of junk food laying on the kitchen table waiting for me. At some point late in the night, I got a huge craving for it and ended up binge eating way, way too much. I regretted it immediately after, and texted her asking why she bought it and telling her what I'd just done.\n\nI woke up to find that she'd group texted me and my sister with a sob story telling us that she's just trying to help, thinks she's not longer needed, and will stay out of our lives from now on. This made me furious because she had brought my sister into it with no context instead of replying to my personal message. I was getting worried texts from my sister asking what's wrong and what's happened. It also seems to me like my mom was retaliating in a way, by taking my demand to leave my eating habits alone to the extreme. I called her and blew up, telling her the ugly details of my binge eating for the first time and how she had enabled it. I told her she was being manipulative by bringing my sister into it and that bringing that much junk food for me was like offering alcohol to an addict. She responded by taking back her \"apology\" text and reiterating that she'd stay out of my life.\n\nI don't want to distance myself from my mother, and I know that she isn't serious about staying out of my life completely either. I'm not sure if my addict comparison was over the top, or whether making my mom out to be partially responsible for my binge eating is justified. AITA?\n\nEDIT- My family technically lives together but is gone 6 days of the week. All the food I talked about is **not** shared or meant for anyone else. It is bought/cooked explicitly for me.- My thoughts and response on this **don't apply** to anyone else that offers unhealthy food. I have no problem turning anyone else down. My mom just has the unique ability to make me feel guilty for turning down her offers or throwing out what she buys for me.\n\nEdit 2 typo \n        ",

It's clearly stated that the excessive food is specifically intended for the child, respecting someone's diet preference and health journey is critical. Ignoring the child's wishes, the mother continues to enable unhealthy feeding habits, making it harder for the child to maintain their current diet plan. \n\n3. The mother's reaction to being called out on her actions, which involved emotionally manipulative techniques such as pulling in a third party (the sister), and threatening to stay out of their lives, is problematic and dismissive. It can induce feelings of guilt and anxiety, which is manipulative behavior.\n\n4. Using family relationships to leverage emotional situations and manipulating reactions disrupts healthy communication.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for trying to get a school director fired for wrongfully accusing me of hurting my daughter? | I like to think I\u2019m a good dad; my daughter, Manon (6 yo) seems to think so too. Earlier this year, I defeated her in a game of Mario Kart, which coincidentally happened not long after she tripped and fell in the yard, which resulted in a small bruise. I didn\u2019t think anything of it until the director of Manon\u2019s school summoned me for an \u201curgent\u201d meeting the very next day.\n\nIn my language, the word for beating someone in a video game is the same one as beating someone up physically. As it turns out, a teacher apparently heard that I \u201cbeat\u201d Manon, saw the bruise and assumed I hit her. When I arrived to the meeting, the director, all of Manon\u2019s teachers, the school nurse and a social worker were there. They were like a tribunal, except they had already decided I was guilty.\n\nThe whole exchange was extremely painful for me, because they would just repeatedly say \u201cWe know you hurt Manon, confess it and we can help you,\u201d and when I tried to clear up the situation, they\u2019d not listen and just repeat \u201cYou have to admit you have a problem with violence.\u201d When I suggested we just ask Manon to clear things up, they refused because \u201cWe don\u2019t want her to relive her trauma.\u201d I recorded part of the exchange because I was so insanely angry (the fact I was out of my mind with anger probably didn\u2019t help my case).\n\nWell, the police was called, I went through several interrogations by policemen and a social worker, and so did Manon. It was a whole ordeal - I wasn\u2019t ever in danger as I was innocent, but it was a source of a lot of anxiety and it took a lot of time. Every step of the way, I tried to shield Manon from what was going on and she was just confused by the attitude of her teachers and why people asked her weird questions about her dad sometimes.\n\nI used to be super involved with the school events, and I stopped doing that after the accusation. Even when picking up Manon after school, teachers would sometimes refuse to let her go with me and demand that her mom come instead (my wife usually works at that time and can\u2019t pick her up). When they accepted to let Manon come home with me, I still felt judged, like teachers were convinced they were sending an innocent victim in the clutches of her abuser. That kept going even after I was completely cleared.\n\nWell, I documented every step of the process, and at the end I submitted it all to the regional educational authority (not sure if there\u2019s even a word for it in english) which oversees all schools in the area. I don\u2019t know what came of it as the school year is over, but I assume I was taken at least somewhat seriously. The director tried to contact me; he sent me a couple mails asking to meet to \u201cclear up a misunderstanding\u201d and I have several missed calls from the school. It took all my willpower to not reply to him with \u201cYou have to admit you have a problem with wrongfully accusing innocents\u201d - but I still wholeheartedly hope this guy will get fired. AITA for that?\n\nEdit: Wow, this blew up. I can't reply to all these messages, so I will just address a few key things I noticed in numerous comments:\n\n- I am NOT American. Sorry, people who keep talking about CPS and American laws, I am actually French.\n\n- I was (still am) very emotional about the whole thing, but many comments make a good point; it is true that the school did what would have been the right thing if there had been real abuse. I am glad to know the staff cares about the kids' safety, although it really fucked me over.\n\n- The school didn't let me take Manon home directly after the meeting, I had to talk to policemen first. They were thankfully much more willing to listen to me and things smoothed out afterward. I am mostly pissed off about the meeting itself and how I was treated/how nobody listened to me.\n\n- The teacher didn't \"kidnap\" Manon. That's something I didn't expect to see but many comments say it. Sorry, that part was definitely exaggerated. It wasn't like the teachers completely refused to let Manon come home with me and wanted to keep her at school forever. Instead, it was a lot of suspicious looks, snide comments or just pronouncing my name with disdain, asking me several times if my wife is available to pick up Manon, and when told no, that I should *really* ask my wife to be the one to come next time. The worst instances were soon after the meeting, and it happened only a few times. The teachers would ask me to wait next to the director's office while they went inside, talked some, then came back out to ask me if I was *absolutely certain* my wife couldn't free herself to pick up Manon instead, then back in the director's office to talk some more before finally letting Manon come with me.\n\n- After seeing so many different opinions on the matter, I think I see things more clearly, so thank you very much! I will discuss things with my wife, Manon, my local community, then I will ask for a meeting with the school again. I think I will ask for an apology letter and that the director makes it very clear to all his staff that I am innocent. I will keep you posted, Reddit! Thanks again.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. While the initial accusations against the father were unfortunate and a result of a misunderstanding, it is essential to recognize the school's actions were made in an attempt to protect a child's wellbeing. This demonstrates the school's commitment towards child safety, though better communication could have helped avoid this conflict. The father's actions to clear his name are also acceptable. Misunderstandings can occur, especially around sensitive topics, but when reputations and relationships are damaged, it is reasonable to seek justice and ask for an apology. Therefore, seeking a method to rectify a wrongfully made accusation is fair and aligns with human commonsense."

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for Questioning Tax on Restaurant Bill? | Hello All\n\nI live in VA in the USA and I just moved to the area. The area in which I live is extremely developed and high cost but also has  a lot of cultural restaurants . Earlier this evening, I decided to try a Mexican place for dinner for the first time. I ordered a Burrito that was priced at $11.99 per the menu. When I went to pick the food up, I was quoted $13.20. I asked to view the receipt and there was my burrito along with a \"tax\" for $1.20. Normally, I don't care but quick math told me that they were charging me %10 sales tax rate. I googled my areas \"sales\" tax rate and it showed only up to 6%. This restaurant was a mom and pop so there really was no description on WHERE the tax was actually going. I asked for a description of the tax (i.e. Virginia sales tax) and was told by the owner to either pay my bill or leave. At that point, I got pissed because it seemed like they are charging customers extra gratuity under the guise of \"tax\" purposes. I would be fine with paying as long as I know beforehand. The owner eventually figured I was serious, and gave me a \"discount\" that mirrored a more reasonable price. I took the food and left. Later, I ended up getting the answer from a Reddit user after posting this story in one of the legal subs. Turns out there is a special meal tax that is added onto state tax in some cities. I was wrong and people are calling me a prick for the way I handled the situation. However, I disagree. In the USA, 10% sales tax is highly unusually and thus I was well within my rights to question the charge. Its the merchants responsibility to be able to explain each charge on the bill. I also was dealing with the owner of the restaurant and not some part-time bar tender. Also the amount is not really relevant for the reasoning because had I paid $100 then I would have had a $10 \"tax\" charge which definitely would have required an explanation. I was not rude in the way I asked, but I was holding up those behind me. The owner could have easily taken a few minutes to get the answer for me. I also think that the receipt should have had a description of each individual tax add to avoid such confusion.\n\nAITA for pressing for an explanation of my bill?\n\nEDIT: My questioning wasn't only about THIS bill.....It was about understanding the laws of the state going forward for future transactions. I shouldn't have had to post to a Reddit forum to get an answer. Its the merchants responsibility to know what the individual tax charges are. Also I'm not interested in the opinions of those that live outside of the United States, as tax law and government accountability differs around the world.\n\nEDIT: While most have condemned me for being ignorant about local tax law before questioning the owner, Its obvious that many of those making the judgements aren't even bothering to read the post causing the facts to become twisted. **I did not openly accuse the owner of scamming me**, I simply asked for clarification about a charge in a polite manner. I don't mind being called an AH but at least base your judgements off the facts presented in the post.\n\nFINAL EDIT: I accept the overwhelming judgement that I'm an AH for holding up the line for other customers, but I'm not wrong for pushing the owner to know the details of certain charges that I would have to pay for (which was the actual question). In the end, I guess  I'd rather be an AH that knows where their money is going than a ignorant nice guy.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. Chain of Thought explanation: Firstly, the person was right to question an unexpected additional cost, as it's essential to know specifics of charges. However, the issue lies in the manner of handling - continuing to confront the owner even after their initial response, causing delay for other customers. Ignorance about local tax law doesn't justify creating a scene. It reflects an urgent need for patience, respect for others' time, and due investigation before questioning. Instead, the person could have accepted the receipt, paid, and further researched or sought legal advice for their concerns, ensuring a smooth process and respect for others' time.\n"

However, the ethical objection arises when they initially refuse the request to walk the mother down the aisle. It's not just about their relation with the groom, but their relation with the mother too. If her son's wedding is an important occasion for her and she desires your husband's presence in a specific role, refusing based on the lack of brotherly bond might be considered ethically objectionable, as it doesn't respect her wishes on a significant day. However, the scenario becomes more acceptable when the husband acknowledges his initial mistake and agrees to fulfill his brother's request out of respect."

Instead, open and constructive dialogue should be employed to express insecurities. Furthermore, the boyfriend's demand for absolute trust is also ethically questionable. Trust isn't something to be demanded; it is gained through patterned and consistent behavior. Ultimately, it's a matter of finding a middle ground through healthy communication and patience, not through ultimatums or coerced digital transparency."

At the time we signed the agreement, there were 4 girls whom the landlady told us will be staying there the following year. According to her, they agreed to buy the fridge, the oven, the washing machine, and my armoire. My friend was under the impression (as I was) that the appliances would stay till the end of the lease. \n\nTwo weeks before the end of the lease our landlady tells us the girls backed out and we are frantically trying to sell our stuff. We were under the impression they\u2019d already signed. My roommate who owns the fridge and oven found someone who was willing to buy them, but he said he cannot buy it after Aug 8, 4 days before the lease ends. My friend who subletted is a nutritionist who needs a fridge and oven to do her job and said she could not survive without it, therefore she has to move out 4 days earlier because she can\u2019t live a single day without the fridge and oven. \n\nWhen I offered her the place, i told her what i knew at the time - that the appliances are staying for the new tenants. She is acting as if I purposely misled her and is being extremely passive-aggressive, telling me she learned her lesson for next time never to sign a sublease without going over these kinds of terms. She implied I owe her for the four days she can\u2019t stay due to \u201cexcessive hardship\u201d and lamented that she is moving out \u201cat a loss,\u201d which is essentially a manipulation - making me feel like I\u2019m a bad person if I don\u2019t pay her back. I offered to let her use my fridge and oven for those days (but I live on the other side of town) and she declined. \n\nMeanwhile my husband and I are barely making ends meet, as we are both students and living off my shitty part time job and his tiny PhD stipend, which is seriously a joke. That 80$ US is a big dent into our funds. We can\u2019t pay her for those days, as she told me she was going to stay for a month and paid me accordingly, had I known she were not I\u2019d have tried to find a sublet in advance (Airbnb style). \n\nAm I the (cheap) asshole for telling her that I\u2019m sorry this happened but I had planned for her to be staying the whole month so I can\u2019t return the pro-rated rent money for those 4 days? I feel awful and she\u2019s making me feel like a terrible person for this, but my husband insists I\u2019d be a huge sucker if I wired her the money and urged me not to. \n\nEDIT TO ADD: my parents were paying my rent but completely cut me off financially after I got married, as that\u2019s the custom in my culture. \n\nEDIT2: my husband thinks I should add that I lent her the furniture for free, including bedding, and only charged her the exact rent I paid. I also did not include appliances as part of the agreement - she knew they belonged to my roommates. We just thought the new tenants would buy them, and we relayed what our landlady had told us, but it was not in the official agreement. Only the furniture I owned was. We had both taken it for granted that the appliances were staying in the apt \n\n**UPDATE: I found a friend willing to lend a mini-fridge, let\u2019s see if she responds** \n\nTL:DR\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my friend, nicely, that it\u2019s not my problem that my roommates sold the appliances without consulting her, having not seen it coming?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because, firstly, it involves lack of clear communication between involved parties. While the original leaser (Leaser A) wasn't directly responsible for the sale of the appliances, when allowing a sublet there should be clear understanding and agreement on the living conditions and included amenities. The sublettor made her decision based on the understanding that necessary amenities such as the fridge and oven would be present, which was a valid assumption given the context, especially as they are significant for her profession. When the appliances were sold without Leaser A having secured buyers for after the sublettor's duration, it compromised the living conditions and failed to maintain the conditions initially agreed upon.\n\nSecondly, the direct owner of the fridge and oven (Roommate) also acted without considering the needs of the current occupant (sublettor), thus, showing disregard for her welfare. This is viewed as ethically questionable.\n\nLastly, the sublettor's resort to pressure Leaser A for financial compensation also maneuvers guilt and leverage, which could be viewed as ethically dubious. However, it stems from her situation that has been drastically altered due to no fault of her own. Therefore, while there seems to be a lack of perfect victims or culprits, the scenario overall lacks proper respect for mutual agreement, clear communication, and consideration for others' welfare, rendering it ethically unacceptable."

This includes the protagonist's decision of not sitting on her boyfriend's lap. It's based on her comfort level and insecurities about her own size, not on disrespect or intention to embarrass him. The protagonist was also considerate enough to express her concerns about it being awkward if she had to get off his lap soon after sitting. Her intention was to avoid discomfort and awkwardness. Although it may have seemed embarrassing at the moment, her decision was a righteous act of self-care, and not dictated by any malice or intent to hurt or humiliate her boyfriend.

The boyfriend, upon knowing about the girlfriend's financial situation, can then decide if he wants to help her financially.

Honestly I don\u2019t care what they think, and I never have. The thing is that weddings in Singapore can cost average $50,000. I do have the money but I don\u2019t want to spend it all on one day.  I have suggested that maybe we can have a cheaper wedding, but then again she\u2019s worried about face, which I cant blame her.Some have also suggested that I can borrow money from relatives, but I feel really uncomfortable doing so as I dont want them to waste their money. Currently my fianc\u00e9 is crying about it and her friends are really pressuring me, but I feel like this is something i have to put my foot down on.\n\nEdit: Okay I am getting tired of replying the same thing over and over, i am already sounding rhetorical.\n\nI am not against having a wedding, i dont want an expensive wedding like how her friends do. I don\u2019t believe in spending money because i am pressured to or because i feel it would make me more happy. Spending 50-60k in one night is just never going to sound reasonable to me. I would rather spend more money on a nice honeymoon, as I see more value in it.I want to pay for the wedding, i want to take on the responsibility and not be a burden to my retired in-laws. I want to show them that im different than the social norm and im going to spend money smartly which i think will leave a better impression on everybody than an overly expensive wedding. I want the best for my fianc\u00e9 and I, and i know that living with in-laws is troublesome, so i went out and got an apartment that i paid for myself to surprise my fiance. To me im just trying to setup our future so we can be happy and she can have less stress.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The individual demonstrates a clear understanding of his financial responsibilities and priorities. His aversion to expensive weddings aligns with frugality and effective resource allocation, as he exhibits a desire to provide for their future. However, the conflict arises from differing cultural expectations and personal preferences between himself and his fianc\u00e9. Ethically, he is not obligated to conform to societal pressures at the expense of personal financial security. Despite her emotional distress, he is not acting unethically by pushing back against these societal norms. Nevertheless, the ethical course of action would be an open discussion and compromise to reconcile the couple's diverging views. His attitude towards the situation maintains respect for his future spouse and his own beliefs and values. It's crucial to remember that context is key in ethical dilemmas like this, and different societies may have different viewpoints on this matter. Nonetheless, according to human commonsense, his proposal is not ethically unacceptable."

I\u2019m going to leave all doors unlocked I may be in shower but come in and I\u2019ll leave the machine out.   \n\nMy girl lived alone in a studio apartment in Los Angeles that has room for a bed and a chair and that\u2019s about all the room.  The dude in question was a business associate of my girlfriend\u2019s, the businesses being the distribution of mathematics study aids and roofing materials.  He did not end up coming through on the day in question but we argue about it all the time.  She says nothing happened and I say intent matters.  To me, she clearly was sending a signal that she was down to fuck this dude.  The old shower trick has been in rotation since that British nurse seduced the American Werewolf in the 80s.  She says I\u2019m crazy and nobody else would interpret those texts like I did.  Is she right?\n\n\n\n\nI appreciate the insight so far.  Ironically, the people who think I am reading too much into the texts are reading too much into my post.  It appears I gave you too much information.  You are distracted by details you have invented about me, her and our relationship.  None of them are relevant.  You're making assumptions which you then use to make arguments.  This is a reading exercise and you are all out of shape.  But I've got something really offensive to add to this conversation.  \n     \n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. This is due to few reasons, namely:\n\n1. Invasion of privacy: The fact that the girlfriend was willing to let someone enter her house while she was in the shower, without explicit consent or comfort established beforehand, breaches common boundaries of privacy. This can spark distrust in a relationship.\n\n2. Insecurity: The boyfriend's distrust and negative interpretation of their interaction indicates a lack of trust and insecurity. This is unhealthy in a relationship and can lead to unwarranted criticism and negativity.\n\n3. Name-calling and disrespect: Labeling the girlfriend with negative terms (slut-shaming) is ethically unacceptable. It reflects a lack of respect and objectification. This is not a constructive or respectful way to handle disagreements or suspicions in a relationship.\n\n4. Assumptions and accusations: Making assumptions and hurling accusations without proof or a fair dialogue is unfair and causes harm. This leads to conflict and destroys trust.\n\n5. Lack of open communication: Instead of discussing his concerns openly with his girlfriend, the boyfriend jumped to negative conclusions. This lack of open and fair communication is not conducive to a healthy relationship.\n\nIn sum, the actions and reactions showcased in the scenario are not aligned with fundamental principles of respect, trust, fairness, and open communication, which are foundational to any ethical relationship according to common sense."

April Fools! We\u2019re not. Specifically I posted \u201c[Birth Announcement] 2: Electric Boogaloo, Due Fall 2019\u201d. Of course there were some people who took it at face value and liked it and congratulationed us, some were quick to comment with April Fool\u2019s skepticism, others congratulationed us with the caveat \u201cif it\u2019s real\u201d to make sure we knew we didn\u2019t totally fool them in the event it was a joke. Here\u2019s the troublesome part: some folks decided to call me out for extreme insensitivity toward people who have suffered through infertility/miscarriage/stillbirth saying that I shouldn\u2019t joke about things that have brought people so much pain. None of the people leveling these accusations have personally struggled through those circumstances yet friends of mine who have were fine with the joke. I said I\u2019m willing to give any necessary apologies to people who were directly hurt but told the complainers to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people and have, so far, refused to admit any wrongdoing or apologize to anyone. \n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. A chain of thought to clarify would be as follows:\n\n1. Sensitivity: Announcing a fake pregnancy on social media can be insensitive to those dealing with infertility or loss. Even if a specific person is not directly affected, it is good practice to consider how your actions affect a wider audience. \n\n2. Respect: It's important to respect real life situations that can cause emotional distress. Pregnancy isn't a casual subject for many people, and making light of it can come across as disrespectful.\n\n3. Offending Others: If your actions have been called out as hurtful, it's important to listen and try to understand the point of view. Dismissing these concerns, even if the people affected aren't immediately present, can be seen as dismissive and lacking empathy.\n\n4. Apologies: As a responsible individual, if you realize your prank has hurt or upset people, it's only ethical to apologize and learn from the situation. Defending the prank based on the fact that some friends were okay with the joke neglects the diverse feelings and experiences of your broader audience."

There was a guest checked in earlier that day that has a dog and claimed them as a service dog. Throughout the afternoon/early evening I saw the guest leave and come back to the hotel with the dog. \n\nAs per prior training, of the dog is left alone in the room without the person it is trained to be providing service for, it is no longer a service dog. *side note: in hotels, emotional support dogs/pets are NOT classified as service dogs and service animals are always dogs. \n\nThese guests left the hotel without the dog, so as they were exiting I asked them if they were bringing the dog with them.

I show him a google search result that says banks won\u2019t ask for your pin and he refuses to hang up, saying they need more info to send us a replacement card and how our online account will be inactive for a while, not suspicious at all right? I finally mute his phone and tell him to hang up it\u2019s a scam. Finally he hangs up, and I compose myself and say call the actually bank and try and get the cards shut off. This takes some time so we\u2019re both hungry and I\u2019m a little peeved he ignored me and fell for something so obvious. Luckily I have 20 dollars in my wallet so we go to have lunch. When we finally sit down I kinda jab into a bit, I said \u201cwhat were you thinking!, I can\u2019t believe you fell for that and ignored me\u201d.

It's reasonable for one partner to express concern or frustration when they believe the other partner is making a serious mistake, especially when it relates to joint financial matters. Your concern primarily stemmed from an attempt to prevent fraudulent activity on your shared account, a matter that directly impacts both your lives. However, it's also important to communicate these concerns in a respectful and understanding manner. As humans, it's common to make mistakes and learn from them, and while it's clear your intentions were for the well-being of your household, it's justifiable for your husband to feel embarrassed and upset. Your repeated reminiscence of the event might come off as rubbing it in rather than a genuine expression of worry or concern. Thus, while the core intention is morally justified, the handling of the situation should be revisited to ensure it doesn't strain the relationship.

I know how this title makes me sound but I want to preface this by saying I truly and deeply care about my girlfriends health, safety, and comfort more than my own. I\u2019ve been known to be very cautious with germs and very dirty places, especially now more than ever. I typically avoid areas or stores where I know they\u2019re more run down and not taken care of, and try to stay away from places that I know to be more germ infested. \n\nThis past weekend, my girlfriend of 3 years and I went over to our friends house. Obviously, we\u2019re trying to stay away from the general public as much as we can so we stayed in, drank some wine, and ordered some Chinese food. Our friends house is about a 45 minute drive from our own apartment but it\u2019s never been an issue until now. When we left our friends house, it was around 10pm. We live in a very rural part of our state, and while there are different stores on the drive to and from our friends house, most stores in our town have been closing earlier than usual. \n\nAbout 10 minutes into the drive, my girlfriend mentions that she has to pee. My first reaction is to ask if she used the bathroom at our friends house to which she says no. No big deal I think, we\u2019re about half an hour away from our apartment so I ask if she can hold it. She seems hesitant and mentions a gas station about 5 minutes away from us. In the 45 minute drive, there was only one gas station open on the way home. It\u2019s a very run down, small, dirty gas station right off the highway. Because it\u2019s pretty much the only store open right now, it\u2019s been packed with visitors at all times of the night. \n\nBecause of this, I tell my girlfriend that I refuse to stop there. I list my reasons, stating that it would be too busy right now, how dirty it was, and that there was no guarantee the bathrooms would even be open. While my girlfriend seemed upset at this, she didn\u2019t really argue. I felt bad so I offered to pull off to the side of the rode and either let her go by the car or use an empty cup we had. She debated until we passed the small gas station, and i think once she realized I wasn\u2019t going to stop, she requested that I pull over on the side of the road. She ended up peeing on the side of the road next to our car. \n\nWhen she came back in the car, she was furious at me and felt humiliated because the street was somewhat busy and cars kept driving by us. She stated that I should\u2019ve just stopped at the gas station and let her use the bathroom, but I stay firm in thinking I made the right decision by worrying about my girlfriends health and exposure to dirty areas.

While your concern for her health was reasonable, making her use the roadside as a toilet compromised her dignity and comfort, which is a key part of respect in a relationship. Her feeling humiliated at the end illustrates the impact on her. You could have let her make the decision given the situations and her comfort as an adult.

I didn't have very much money on me, but I was working apart time job all through the school year earning whatever I could and saved whatever I could (thanks to my father, who was GREAT at saving money). My mother on the other hand, had a persistent shopping addiction and couldn't comprehend the thought of saving money.\n\nI didn't have a lot on me at the time, but I saved saved enough to get my sister a gift for her first born son. At the time, I kept a piggy bank and collected about $50 of change (which took ALOT of time to scavenge up), but I never intended to spend it. It was for emergencies only. However, I noticed it was suspiciously empty and noticed someone had took out all of the change.\n\nEventually I found out it was my mother, and she never intended to tell me if I had never asked. She gave me the usual \"how dare you question me, I have given you everything\" and how I should give her anything I had whenever she asked for it. At this point, I had always bought her things such as fancy work shoes, clothes from American eagle, Victoria Secret Bras (yuck). Anyway, she made me feel bad because she \"didn't have any money\" at the time, even though she worked a full time job, but decided to spend the 50$ in change on a very fancy bouquet of flowers for my sister who had given birth. I already bought my gift for my sister at the time, but my mother pointed out how \"cheap\" my gift was, despite using MY PIGGY BANK to buy her own expensive gift that she claimed for herself.\n\nMy dad told me to not bring it up because it would agitate her.\n\nAm I the asshole!?\n        ",

Respect for personal property is a basic ethical norm regardless of whether the property owner is a child or an adult. In addition to this, the mother was not transparent about her actions and violated her son's trust, which is also ethically unacceptable. The son had saved that money over a significant period of time which points to the value he placed on it. Therefore, stealing it and not admitting to it until confronted is a breach of trust, respect and personal rights. Lastly, belittling her son's gift for his sister after wrongfully using his money to purchase a more expensive gift is disrespectful and uncalled for.

Me and Maria were the only two of the whole group who smoked so we occasionally went out for a cigarette together, maybe once every 30 minutes.\n\nWe had some fun talks when smoking and she told me all about her husband, who was at home taking care of their two kids so she could go out with her friends. As the night went on, our groups had kind of split into smaller groups, and me and Maria were pretty much just talking to each other. \n\nJust as the night was coming to an end, and we had all successfully gotten pretty wasted, we again went for a cigarette.

As we were halfway through our drunken conversation she tells me about how she enjoys her fitness and runs everyday. I begin complimenting her on her body and how good she looks. She was enjoying the compliments and kept telling me how nice I seemed and that she thought I was a great guy. Then she looks me right in the eye, and leans in to kiss me. \n\nI was pretty surprised as she had been talking about her husband and kids a lot but I just went with it and we made out for around 5 minutes before we decided we needed to go back in to our friends.

The person in question here, knowingly made out with Maria, who was confirmed married, going against this principle. \n\nNext, his actions could potentially harm not only Maria's relationship with her husband, but also affect their children if the truth ever comes out. Thus, engaging in such an act knowingly is seen as ethically unacceptable due to potential consequences on Maria's family. \n\nFinally, placing personal interests and desires above the respect and consideration for another's committed relationship is generally viewed as a lack of moral integrity.

Every person deserves respect and dignity, and these should not be compromised even in a temporary relationship.\n\n2. The individual seems to have predetermined that the relationship will not last. While this outcome may not be entirely in their control, this mindset might prevent the individual from fully investing in and appreciating the relationship. \n\n3. The statement, \"practicing what being in a relationship is like,\" suggests that one party is in the relationship primarily to learn rather than to genuinely connect with the other person. Fairness and reciprocity are key principles in maintaining a healthy relationship, and they seem to be lacking in this context.\n\n4.

He wasn't rich, but he had money and was alwaysdoings stuff with his family so I figured he would have at least a little to help me. \n\nBut all he said was: \"can't help you,,you know that. Just find a job\". And after that he never tried to contact me again.\n\nRight after that my mom received a very high restitution form the state and literally gave it all to me. I went to college, graduated, got a amazing job and now I paying for my sister's college.\n\nLast month my mom made a FB post saying how much she was grateful to have me as her daughter because I was helping with my sister education and then out of the blue my dad decided to contact me and ask for me to help with his other daughter college too. I said I couldn't because I was already paying for my sister's and I was saving to buy a apartment. I also said that maybe she should get a job. I felt really great, but then them he started to say I was being a vindictive a-hole. He made a FB post about it and now a lot of people are agreeing with him to the point where I'm reconsidering it.\n\nEDIT: \n\nWow, this really blew up. I decided to make this edit because it would take me forever to respond every individual message. \n\nFirst, I want to thank you for how nice all were. Also, really thank you for whoever sent the wards, you didn't need, this is just a troaway account. \n\nSecond, I decided I wont be making a FB post to respond to him. A lot of you said I should post my side of the sorry, but tbh I don't think people will care. The ones that are on his side knows he was never present and knows my mom was sick, they just think I should help because we're \"family\" and nothing will really change their mind. \n\nThirdly, I decided to help his kids. I know I have no obligation to them, I know that maybe he's lying about his money problems, but it's just hard for me to see a person I'm technically related to in a situation I struggled so much with. But I won't be given them money per say. A very good friend of mine works teaching for a college in my city, it's far from the best school, but they offer a lot of scholarships and they are cheaper than most. He said he could get up to 25%. As I said, it's really not the best school, but it's still better than nothing if you're in need. They could try getting a loan for the other 75% or something.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. Here's a chain of thought to explain why:\n\n1. Abandonment and Abuse: The father had abandoned the narrator early on, and even when present, was mentally abusive. This creates no obligation for the narrator to assist him later in life.\n\n2. Financial Struggle: The father refused to provide any financial assistance when the narrator's family was in dire need, placing more pressure and responsibility on the narrator.\n\n3. Emphasis on self-reliance: The father's response to the narrator's plea for help was to get a job, indicating that he values self-reliance over familial support.\n\n4. The father's new request: When the father asked for help for his other daughter's college, the narrator was already supporting her sister's education and saving for her own future. This is a reasonable ground to refuse, reinforced by her father's insistence on self-reliance earlier.\n\n5. Not giving money directly: The narrator still chose to help by trying to provide an actual solution to get his other daughters education at a lower cost, demonstrating they are not being vindictive but being rational in their decisions.\n\nThese points prove the protagonist's actions are in line with the principle of fair treatment and reciprocation, which explains why the scenario is ethically acceptable according to human commonsense."

Newly Married, car financial disagreement | \nBefore our recent marriage my wife had bought new vehicles so often that she is now currently 14k upside down.  ie. purchasing a 20k car means we have to finance 34k.  A few years ago I made the down payment on her current vehicle, Honda Accord (before marriage as a gift) with the mutual understanding/agreement/negotiation that this vehicle would be the one to pay off over time and own outright and eliminate being upside down.\n\nWell this vehicle was recently rear ended and fully repaired.  No mechanical damage, car runs great, repair was excellent.  \n\nShe is insisting that we trade in now before the vehicle loses its trade in value due to the reported accident.  I believe this is a non factor as the plan was to own and pay off this vehicle.  It\u2019s trade in after the terms of the loan wouldn\u2019t be outstanding regardless.  \n\nAs a result she wants me to pay off her current upside down value (14k) which non of will apply to down payment and purchase a new vehicle using the reasoning that she needs an suv with a hitch to tow our recently purchased kayaks and also to make it down dirt roads.  I believe these are poor reasons to purchase a new vehicle for another 7 years and that I\u2019m only contributing to paying off bad debt and that she may want to do another trade in in the next 2 years.  \n\nWell sufficed to say she\u2019s super angry with me and believes I don\u2019t love her now, threatened divorce etc, as I have opted out to paying for another vehicle that doesn\u2019t get her ahead, just puts her further behind.  \n\nI love my wife and want to provide and help her out of this but I feel like we\u2019ll just have to do this again in 2 years as history and current situation have proven.\n\nAITA??\n        ",

His friends often come over to hang out and occasionally to sleep over. Our house is large so they like coming here. \n\nLast year, my son\u2019s best friend Tom (also 18) came with us on a family vacation at our beach house. During that time I noticed that he would always be staring at my wife and checking her out. Once, he walked in on her changing in a bathroom, and claimed that he \u201cdidnt know it was occupied\u201d.

This is problematic as it accepts the boys' behavior as inevitable and shifts the responsibility onto the woman to manage that behavior. From the standpoint of human commonsense ethics, it would be more appropriate to address this issue with the son and his friends, emphasizing respect towards all individuals. It's also ethically unacceptable that Tom's inappropriate comments and behavior haven't been addressed properly yet.

It\u2019s first class all the way, literally, first class airline seats and the hotels are 5 star. It took me about a two years to earn the points and it was meant to be my 5th anniversary gift to her. We had a daughter a year and a half ago and before she got to big to remember, we were going to leave her with the grandparents for one last couple adventure before she left for university. \n\nIt was also something special for me because I am a huge plane geek and I booked the flights and routes so maximize the chance to experience long-haul flights on planes I wouldn\u2019t otherwise fly. \n\nThe Issue\n\nMy wife has Chron\u2019s and about 4 weeks ago started experiencing a bad flare. Like bad! She finally agreed to go to the hospital last week and was admitted for 4 days. It turns out she was skipping medication doses because she was worried about getting cancer. This made me angry but I also understand the fear. There is an increased chance of lymphoma but it\u2019s very slight and it doesn\u2019t matter if you take one dose or 10, its the same risk. She didn\u2019t believe me when I told her what I\u2019d read, she did believe her uncle thats a surgeon, who set her straight this week. I digress. \n\nThankfully she is fine. A small meds adjustment, a heavy dose of antibiotics and a \u201cdon\u2019t ever do that again\u201d talking too from the doc and she was discharged a week ago. I am grateful to have her home. I hate an empty bed and I was truly scared. \n\nAs a result of the flare, her doctors are telling her not to travel for a few months (up to 3) until she\u2019s cleared of any new inflammatory markers. \n\nGiven the way I booked the trip and our insurance, I can cancel and recoup 90% of the fees and taxes I paid to book. \n\nThe Argument\n\nI still want to go and today I asked her if she would mind me taking a male friend instead, who will cover the fee portion of his ticket. My family will still help with our daughter so my wife can have a break as well while I\u2019m gone. \n\nShe said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d and we had an argument. No yelling but a lot of frustration. Her point is that it was supposed to be for us and it\u2019s not fair. My point is that I have already booked the time off, it will take another year to find open award space and that she did this to herself by messing with her meds. \n\nLastly, and I would never throw this in her face, but I earn 95% of our household income and I need a vacation! So, yes, I feel entitled to one, even with just a friend of mine. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to go and arguing wit her about it?\n\nEDIT: I should add that the trip is obviously during the 3 months she now can\u2019t travel and I can also get the points back along with the fees that I mentioned. \n        ",

He is more focused on his own needs for a vacation rather than caring for his wife who\u2019s recovering from a serious health scare.\n   \n2. Abandonment: With his wife dealing with her health, this is a crucial time where she may need his support the most. Going on a trip at this particular time is likely to make her feel abandoned.\n\n3. Insensitivity: Insensitivity is another issue here. His desire to experience the trip with his male friend instead of his wife (with whom he originally planned the trip) might make her feel unimportant and secondary.\n   \n4. Blame: Despite his wife being afraid for her health, he blames her for messing with her meds which led to her not being able to travel, which is a bit unfair and lacks understanding.\n\n5. Entitlement: The husband\u2019s entitlement to the trip because he earns more in the household is an ethically troubling aspect since a marriage ideally is a partnership, not a transaction. This behavior may lead to feelings of inequality and resentment. \n\nSo, these points conclude why this scenario is ethically unacceptable."

Eventually I got sick of this and told her to \u201cfucking shut up already and take my advice!\u201d She\u2019s been very mad at me and I don\u2019t know if I was being too harsh.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for judging my actions! I didn\u2019t expect this to get more than a single comment. The general consensus is that I was being unnecessarily harsh with my friend so I\u2019m being an asshole, and that she is being an asshole as well for what she wants to do.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. This is due to a couple of reasons grounded in human commonsense.\n\nFirstly, your friend's intent to break up an existing relationship is unethical. Based on human commonsense, it demonstrates a lack of respect for others' feelings and relationships. Intervening in someone else's relationship to satisfy personal desires is generally perceived as immoral.\n\nSecondly, the use of harsh language and losing patience with your friend, despite feeling frustrated, is also not ethically acceptable. Ideally, you should maintain respect in communication, even during disagreements. Swears or aggressive language can harm relationships and fail to address the core issue.\n\nSo, both your friend's intentions to interfere in a relationship and your aggressive communication are ethically unacceptable according to human commonsense."

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The reasons are, first, during the punishment period, the father violated his son's privacy by directly interacting with his son's girlfriend via text, an overreach of parental authority and a disrespect of personal boundaries. Second, taking the son's phone, although intended as a disciplinary measure, may be seen as overly intrusive, especially considering the son's age. Parents should ideally respect the communication space between their children and their friends, and interference should be limited and respectful. Lastly, it's generally better to have a discussion and make sure penalties are age-appropriate and proportionate to the offence; forgetting household chores may not merit such a stringent response."

I (25 Male) am a big car guy and as a result, both the vehicles I own are expensive performance cars ( '17 C63 AMG S and '18 Ghibli SQ4 for you car junkies out there) . As a result, I never let anyone who isn't directly under my insurance drive them ( Only my parents and GF ever drive them). In addition, I have around a total of 25k in modifications done to the cars, so I stand to lose that money in the unfortunate event that either car were to be damaged or totaled. Basically, they ended up coming for a short 2 week trip. They decided to use my house as a hub and travel around, which I didn't mind at all. When we discussed their plans for the 2 weeks, it became apparent that they would do a lot of long distance driving ( \\~2000 miles total) . I made sure they were aware that I would not be willing to let them use either car for their trip as they have had a history of not respecting other people's cars ( They filled regular gas in my dad's car before when it requires premium and brushed it off like it was no big deal). Things seemed fine and they booked a rental car, which I got them a huge discount on ( Worked out to an average of 32 bucks a day for a Small SUV) . They are not poor by any means btw, together making around 200k. The trip seemed fine, until after they returned home. My parents told me that apparently they were upset and have been bitching about me being a selfish asshole for forcing them to rent a car despite having two cars. I have an extended family of about 45 people and apparently a good chunk of them have had an earful about this 'act of selfishness' on my part. My aunt and uncle even went as far as to say that I should have considered family members needing to borrow my car before buying such an expensive car. Unfortunately, while my Mom isn't siding with them, she is upset at me for not letting them borrow one of my cars. She says its not a big deal and that nothing would have happened, and even if something would have happened, I could just ' claim insurance'.

Moreover, you showed altruistic behavior by allowing them to use your house as a base for their travel and helped them in arranging a rental car at a discounted rate. Even though they labeled you as 'selfish,' you did not respond with hostility. Addressing such situations assertively is part of creating and maintaining boundaries which is ethically correct and necessary for healthy relationships. Even if your decision created some family disagreement, doing what you believe is right and standing by it is an ethical stance."

Yesterday I was having power steering troubles on the way to work because I ran out of fluid.

They said they weren't going that day, but kindly said I could just use their car if in exchange I brought them back a lemonade drink, to which I agreed. Well when lunch time rolled around I didnt use their car, and rode with a different co-worker instead. We get to the station and I get my power steering fluid, but decided to buy a lemonade for the first co-worker anyways just to be nice. I get back to work and hand it to my coworker who, after a sip, starts complaining about every detail with the drink. Not enough ice, not in a styrofoam cup, the straw was too short(?) Etc. So half-jokingly I said \"here let me see it really quick\" and threw it on the ground. He gets upset and says I threw his drink on the ground and was disrespectful and storms out.

This behavior fails to show respect and consideration for the feelings of the co-worker, which is fundamental to a respectful and civil interaction. Regardless of the drink being bought by the narrator, once it was given, ownership was transferred to the co-worker.

This might have escalated the co-worker's annoyance exponentially, which goes against a fundamental human commonsense ethic to avoid causing unnecessary distress or humiliation to others.

Privacy: Akin to a universal right, everyone is entitled to personal and private space, especially in moments as intimate as bathing or showering. Barging in, particularly without prior permission, is directly infringing upon the individual's right to privacy.\n\n2. Respect: Respect is a fundamental human value necessary to uphold social harmony. It includes respecting boundaries and making sure not to intrude in personal spaces, like during showering.\n\n3. Trust: As a parent, there's an expected trust relationship between you and your child. Breaching that trust by committing acts that infrally upon personal spaces can have long lasting negative effects on this relationship.\n\n4. Consent: Even in family contexts, the consent for sharing personal moments or space is vital. Looking into someone's private time without their knowledge or consent is ethically unacceptable.\n\nThis behaviour not only invades privacy, disrespects personal boundaries, and disrupts the trust in the parent-child relationship but also fails to consider the moral importance of obtaining consent. Hence, it's viewed as ethically unacceptable by human commonsense."

We\u2019ve been engaged for a year and a half and have most things planned already for our wedding.\n\nThe problem started about four months ago though. All of a sudden, we have both sides of our family butting their noses into the wedding and giving their opinions on everything... We even have some weird triangulation where I\u2019ll address something with my future mother in law, and she\u2019ll text him to try to convince him otherwise. \n\nThe worst of it though is my mother. She\u2019s always been my best friend. The problem though is she\u2019s super assertive and takes over anything she works on. With my wedding, she\u2019s decided that she wants to buy all the booze, that we should have custom water bottle labels (which neither my fianc\u00e9 nor I care about), that we now need a day of coordinator, that we need to plan for what people should do between the ceremony and reception, has started bringing on herself to plan these things and more. \n\nSometime we talk for 45min straight with her just telling me what we should do for the wedding. I get 2-3 words in. It\u2019s started happening that if we say no, she gets incredibly upset. We only want a simple wedding, but she keeps making it bigger and more complicated, plus tells us stuff that we want is silly and will confuse people. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that when we get into these conversations, my heart starts pounding really fast and I start feeling super anxious\u2014 to the point I\u2019m getting nightmares of her telling me everything I have to do in my life and that I don\u2019t have enough time to do it all. I\u2019ve woken up in tears from it. I start feeling overwhelmed when we are talking and then I snap and say something like \u201cMom, you aren\u2019t listening to me. I need you to stop. This is too much.\u201d This offends her to the point she yells or cries.\n\nShe\u2019s dealing with some bad work issues and feels unappreciated there. When we don\u2019t use her ideas or tell her to back off a bit, she feels her help is unappreciated for the wedding. I feel like she\u2019s having a bit of a mid-life crisis of not feeling needed anymore. Last night, she told me that she wishes I would have just eloped.\n\nI don\u2019t want my wedding to break apart this close bond my mom and I have always had. I\u2019ve dreamed of my wedding since I was a little girl. Now, all I want is to marry the man I\u2019m in love with. We\u2019ve already spent so much on deposits and my bridesmaids have bought their dresses, otherwise my fianc\u00e9 and I have said we\u2019d cancel it and actually elope.\n\nAITA to tell our family to back off of the wedding and that they will no longer be doing anything?\n        ",

The core of a wedding is the mutual understanding and commitment of the two people getting married, other things are secondary or even tertiary. While it's common for families to offer opinions and show enthusiasm, they should respect your decisions when you express your discomfort and desire for a simpler event. Your mother, despite her good intentions, seems to be taking control beyond your comfort zone, leading to anxiety and anguish for you. It's important to communicate your feelings with your family to avoid misunderstanding and conflict. Your emotional well-being and the maintenance of your relationship with your family, especially your mother, should be prioritized. Therefore, seeking to establish boundaries and requesting family members to take a step back, so you two can plan the wedding as you see fit is not only ethically acceptable but also crucial for your mental health."

It was my sister's birthday recently, and for it she had a potluck style dinner where everyone brought a dish and people just picked at stuff they liked. Myself, my partner, my sister and my brother in law all really love spicy food, and I know a number of her friends do too, so I made ghost chili buffalo wings and took them along. I knew there were gonna be kids at this party, but my sister made signs to put up next to each dish saying what they were, so everybody would know what was what. I made sure she added a warning on the sign for the wings, just to make extra sure that people were aware of how spicy they are. However, in the hustle and bustle of people going to the food table, I guess  some of the signs got knocked over/off the table and things got a bit confused. \n\nThere were kids at this party, namely younger cousins and some of my sister's friends' children. At one point, after the sign for my wings has been knocked down, three of the younger cousins (all under age 12, youngest was 5) grabbed some and tucked in. Immediately, they began complaining that it was too spicy, with the 5 year old fully screaming and crying in pain. She ended up having to go to the hospital as she was puking a lot, and it turned out her stomach lining had been damaged by the spice. (EDIT TO ADD: I definitely should have originally included this but this child does have a history of gastrointestinal issues, so it's possible that contributed as well). I was, of course, mortified that something I had made had hurt a kid so much, however I felt it wasn't really my fault as there was a warning put up and it got knocked over. My aunt disagrees: she keeps telling me I'm sick for bringing something like that to a party where children were, said I should have *known* that the kids would take them and that I was not only irresponsible but actually cruel for bringing such a dish to a party where there were children. I feel awful. I was only trying to take a fun dish I knew my sister would enjoy, and I didn't even consider kids getting at them. AITA for doing this?\n        ",

The individual brought a dish they know is enjoyed by many adults attending the party, while considering the potential hazard for those not accustomed to or not supposed to eat spicy food.

While it's regrettable that the children consumed the dish and one suffered consequences, the individual had made a reasonable attempt to prevent such incident. It could have been beneficial for more vigilance by all adults there to ensure the kids only accessed suitable food, but this does not necessarily make the person bringing the spicy dish ethically unacceptable."

I was not at home when this happened, however, my husband texted me what Martha did. Having said that, her first language isn\u2019t English so I decided to come home quickly and figure out what happened and why they have decided to keep the bird in a small cage. \n\nMartha explained to me that while she was walking home from the shops, she found the bird chirping and playing on the grass. She thought that it looked cute, so she crouched on the floor and called for it to come to her (while waving some bread around) - the bird came to her and she picked it up and held it in her hand to brought it back home. \n\nNow, I\u2019m all for saving animals who are injured or lost - you know, ensure that it\u2019s returned to it\u2019s natural habitat or owner at the end of the day. But I feel like this is just outright kidnapping. \n\nI tried to explain to my husband that, what she did was kidnapping and that we need to let it go. He insisted that it\u2019s someone\u2019s pet and that we need to find out who the owner is to return it. Okay, but how?! You\u2019re locking the bird up and the bird looks absolutely fine.

The bird's wellbeing: The facts that the bird seems healthy, is trying to escape the cage, and appears distressed now that it's caged all suggest that the bird should not be held in captivity. The thinning body condition also indicates potential physical and emotional distress exacerbated by captivity.\n\n3. Kidnapping concern: If the bird is indeed someone's pet, removing it from its original location without explicit permission from the owner is basically theft. It's also not considerate and respectful to potential owners who may be searching for their missing pet.\n\n4. Ownership and responsibility: Even though the individual stays in their in-law\u2019s house and may not have much authority, they still share a moral responsibility for the welfare of the bird, as they are part of the same household. Their inaction or ignoring could be contributing to the bird's distress.\n\n5. Lack of effort in finding the owner: If the family truly believes it's a pet, they should make reasonable steps to locate the owner, rather than just keeping it.\n\nSo, from a perspective of respect for animal life, wellbeing, and potential pet ownership rights, this situation is ethically unacceptable according to human commonsense."

There are a ton of different ways to do this, but the #1 lesson across all of them is consistency.

But there are still public social norms that still need to be followed that people seem to forget as soon as they step into that place.\n\nMy grandma and I took a last minute trip to Disney a few weeks ago before I went back to school. I am not a kid person, however, being at Disneyland, I will overlook the screaming and tantrums and move on with my day, because let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s Disneyland. I love Disney, and won\u2019t let anything ruin my trip. However, the constant touching from children *has* to stop.\n\nFor example, my grandma and I were on the Disneyland train that circles the perimeter of the park. We were one of the first few passengers on, and we had to wait for more people to come before the train could leave the station. A family made up of a mom, dad, boy (maybe 4) and a grandma sat in the row behind us.\n\nAll of a sudden, I felt a small hand, just *stroking* my back a few times. I think it\u2019s an accident, and I shrug it off. The second time it happens, I ever so slightly scooch forward so he won\u2019t be able to touch me. The third time, I now know he\u2019s doing it purposefully. The fourth time, his family notices and just says \u201caww\u201d. I\u2019ve had enough. I turn around say, \u201cI think he\u2019s really cute, but please, I don\u2019t like being touched. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe family just looked at each other in shock that a stranger doesn\u2019t like being touched. I guarantee you that if we weren\u2019t at Disney and were on a regular form of public transportation, they wouldn\u2019t let their kid touch a random stranger. But because we\u2019re at Disney, everyone is just candy and rainbows to them. I think people assume that because I\u2019m a young woman, I\u2019m good with kids. I\u2019m not. I also fear that maybe one day someone who actually is a bad person may lash out on the poor kid, so the parents need to intervene now before it\u2019s too late. \n\nThe next day we went to California Adventure. We were standing in a line with a grandpa and his twin grandsons (maybe 5 or 6) behind us. One kid was just *stroking* my back leg. He wouldn\u2019t stop. The whole 45 min wait, he was stroking the back of my leg. Because of yesterday\u2019s encounter, I debated whether or not to say something. But the line was crossed when I felt a *yank* on my backpack, and I turned around to see the kid had torn off one of my rare pins, and he slid it in his pocket. That was enough.

We have always celebrated Thanksgiving and Christmas with each side of our families separately, like going to my parents and then his in the same day. We have always been the ones driving around on these holidays while both sets of parents stay at home. Everybody is local in the same area. We have discussed staying home now that we have a baby but today we decided to go over to his parents house for Thanksgiving dinner (my parents are out of town). We confirmed with my MIL last week and again this morning that dinner was to be \u201cone-ish\u201d, in her words. This confirmation text was at 12:40 today, it takes a good 30 minutes to get to their house from ours. I went ahead and got the baby ready and we left. (baby has a lot of stuff that goes with her like stroller, diaper bag, etc). When we arrived at 1:40, MIL said, \u201cWell we\u2019ve already eaten, but the food is still out\u201d, like in a \u201cmeh\u201d kind of way.

She told me her mom was there and they'd drive her to the vet, but to meet them there. \n\nThe vet ended up giving my dog medicine to vomit, except she wouldn't vomit there and waited until she was in my car (when me, girlfriend, and the dog were driving back to my place-- her mom went home) to unload everywhere.

[*While she accepts nothing bad has ever happened, she doesn't feel the dog is safe since she will lunge and growl and she doesn't feel strong enough to keep control over the dog. She thought putting her in a room was the safest way to handle things.

Even though her comments were overheard and have caused tension, the issue actually lies in the roommate's disregard for her comfort and boundaries, not in her private conversation. She has an equal right to feel comfortable in her shared living space, and her roommate bringing different girls over frequently and disrespecting her belongings exhibits a lack of respect for shared space and privacy, rather than her comments about the situation."

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for refusing to give up a parking slot to my neighbor in her late 50s? | I live in a boarding house with four parking slots. Maybe 5-6 tenants have cars. As far as I know the rule has always been first come first serve. I've had to park a few streets away sometimes, no biggie.\n\nThe fourth slot is not really a parking slot. It's in the gap between two slots, with a post near the wall, so only small cars can fit. One of the tenants drives a microcar, a little red Wigo, that fits there perfectly. Good for her. She's never had to compete with the rest of us for parking.\n\nAnyway our landlord had his garage repaired, so I came home today to find his giant pickup in one of the parking slots. It's so large that he parked it diagonally, taking up 1 1/2 slots. So I parked diagonally next to him as well, cutting off the little space in front of the post that's usually occupied by the Wigo.\n\nLater that night, the neighboring tenant knocked on my door. She's in her late 50s, lives alone, has no children.\n\nSo she asks me if the sedan outside is mine. I say yes, and she tells me I have to move it so she can park. She also mentions that she's been driving for over an hour and is exhausted.\n\nMe: Isn't it first come first serve for parking here?\n\nNeighbor: Listen, like I told you, I'm very tired. Please just fix how you parked so I can park in my spot.\n\nMe: What do you mean fix it? The landlord's pickup is in the way.\n\nN: Well, what am I supposed to do? I've always parked there. Don't you just park somewhere else when the other slots are full?\n\nMe: Yeah, there's a good spot in the next street, by the blue gate, no one ever cares if you park there. [I prepare to close door]\n\nShe puts up her hand to keep me from closing the door! I am shookt.\n\nN: I can't park there. The pickup took your spot but that doesn't mean you can take mine.\n\nMe: ...it's not yours.\n\nN: I've always parked there.\n\nWell we go around in circles for a bit longer. You can imagine how it goes.\n\nOut of sheer aggravation I went out to try and adjust how I parked, just to see if I could slide in closer to the pickup and leave enough space for her to squeeze in. No dice. So I told her sorry it ain't happening, and she got angry and said she'd tell the landlord, and I said go ahead fam now park somewhere else and leave me alone.\n\nMy friend said my neighbor was wrong in how she approached me, but because she was old and alone and would feel less safe and have more trouble walking, I should have just given her the spot. My friend said I would have probably done just that if my neighbor hadn't been so aggravating, and that by refusing to move I let my anger get the better of me. So... AITA? Should I just move next time? The landlord's pickup will be there for at least a few more days.\n\nTLDR: Older neighbor asked me to give up my parking slot for her, I refused.\n\nEdit: I am also a woman, late 20s. I live with my sister who's out of town. I've shown her the replies so far and she says I didn't have to give up my spot but I should have been nicer to our neighbor and offered to go with her to speak to our landlord tomorrow.\n\nEdit2: thanks so much for all the input. Just to clarify...\n--I'm not guessing her age (good thing because I'm extremely bad at that). I was told. When my sister and I first moved in, we asked if we'd have to worry about loud/rowdy tenants, and this neighbor in particular was described as just that. \"Late 50s, single woman, no roommates, always been quiet and neat and a good tenant.\"\n--I don't think of her as elderly. She also has no disability that I know of. Still, 50 while not elderly is also not young, so I did worry that I might be TA for not making that aspect a primary factor in my decision.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The reasoning can mostly be anchored around the pre-established rule - the parking is on a first-come-first-serve basis. This rule was established to ensure fair usage of common resources among the tenants. The tenant in the story didn't break any rules but instead followed what was set as a guideline by the landlord, thus abiding by the principle of fairness. Although empathy could have led the tenant to bend the rules for the older lady, ethical judgment is not necessarily about empathy but about principles. In this context, that principle was fairness and equality. So, even though the tenant's actions can be viewed as inconsiderate especially considering her neighbor's age, by the standard rules and societal ethics, what she did was acceptable."

We had a discussion with D as soon as she got home today about not calling him that and urging her to have her friend not to, as well. That we should never attack anyone for any kind of disability, no matter their behavior toward you. She said she knows and never called him that. She just told her friend we said to do it.

We talked about coming to us next time there is a problem, immediately, and we will find a way to handle it properly. She and all her neigherhood friends, including OB, had a fun afternoon and had forgive eachother over the name calling today very quickly.\n\nI'm on mobile. So, if the format is wonky, I'm sorry.\nHere's a little background: my daughter(D) is almost 10. She goes out and plays with the other neighborhood kids often.

He yells at them. Pretends like he's going to hit them. Has actually hit her with sticks and twigs. He's gone through our mail and found her animal magazine's that she likes reading and made fun of her for them. Calls her names like a baby. She'll take her scooter outside and let them all ride it. When it's OB's turn, he'll take it and leave. Wont give it back until they chase him down. Stuff like that. \n\nI try not to get involved, because they're kids. And D is EXTREMELY sensitive. She gets her feelings hurt easy, and dwells on things too long.  We've been trying to work with her on it. This includes sticking up for herself. Over the last year, she's really been seeming to find confidence and speak up. Well, my husband and I were talking to her about OB and how she should hit him back when he's picking at her.

But maybe it'll put him in his place.\n\nWell, today D came home and told me about how she told her other friend (OT), who is a year younger, to call OB 'Mushmouth' when he messes with her. And OT did. OB went home, and his little brother was really mad about the name calling. \n\nI do really want D standing up for herself. And I felt good about agreeing to the namecalling.

Sometime after getting engaged and before getting married, we went to the local mall and I picked out a beautiful and affordable ring for us at the time. The issue is not the style or look of the ring, but the materials. Affordable for us at the time meant lower quality metals. To keep the ring nice, it came with instructions not to sleep in it or get it too wet too frequently. The manufacturer of the ring included a warranty that they would replace the ring one time should it get damaged beyond wear. We used that warranty about 1 year after having the ring. \n\nNowadays (well, before the current world situation) I'm a preschool teacher. I'm constantly washing my hands and getting sticky, and other not-good-for-the-ring things. Not to mention that I've owned it for years now and worn it regularly. The rose gold tone is wearing off (like it did before replacing) and the metal underneath makes me itchy and turn green. The stones have lost their luster so it looks permanently dirty. All of this means I can't wear it much anymore. \n\nI found a ring online that was similar in style and made with more quality materials. It is affordable for us (I would be paying for it myself anyway) and I asked my husband about getting it. I told him the issues I have with my current ring being careful not to mention its \"lesser quality\". I tried to explain from a place of \"I'm currently not able to wear my ring frequently and I dont like taking it off\". \n\nHe was less than thrilled. He asked if I wanted to replace all of the jewelry he's gotten for me which is ridiculous. I told him I was looking for an everyday ring and wanted to save the current one for more special occasions. I maybe TA for that because it's not 100% true. If I got this new ring, I dont know that I'd wear my current one anymore. \n\nI feel like he's blowing this way out of proportion.

Second factor is that the existing ring is causing discomfort and is even resulting in skin discoloration from frequent wear. Thirdly, she intends to pay for it herself, suggesting that she is aware of the financial implications and does not wish to burden her partner unnecessarily. Lastly, she isn't denigrating the value of the original ring. She acknowledges its sentimental value, wants to preserve it, and the new ring is considered simply as an upgrade on the original's physical quality.

Please, excuse me if my writing seems a bit complicated as English is not my mother language.Anyway my ex girlfriend who still says she loves me sent me a really great birthday gift today through a delivery service. I was at work when the surpise gift arrived from an anonymous sender. I asked who the sender was but the delivery person refused to say the name and just congratulated me and went away. But I must admit that I had a strong clue of who it was because my ex girlfriend, who I madly was in love with once, have been trying to convince me into starting over together. It\u2019s a long story so I\u2019ll just skip the dramas and jump into the main case.\n\nWhen I unboxed the gift, it was a sweet looking Yamaha guitar and its accessories along with also sweet looking chocolate at the bottom. There was also a little note written in English(she\u2019s a terrible English speaker but the note was beautiful with its own mistakes and passion), and on the guitar there were some words in Korean saying \u201cI love you\u201d from your \u201cNickname\u201d we used to call each other.\n\nIt was really surprising that my co-workers were going crazy all over. Generally I really appreciate all the efforts and her good affection towards me. But I might\u2019ve fucked everything up in the end. I have my own good guitar so I didn\u2019t totally need another one at all. I texted her and expressed my gratitude at first of course but i told her that this gift was a waste. I say \u201cYou could\u2019ve at least asked me if I had a guitar myself, why did you even buy this valuable thing for someone who is no longer your boyfriend?\u201d I think this definitely hurt her feelings as she replied \u201cyou could sell it then if you don\u2019t need it but I was planning to buy it for you for a long time\u201d. Right at this moment, I remembered one thing that could possibly be her reason to buy a guitar for me. There was a short period when she was very sick when we were still together. In order to pay for the right treatment, I sold my previous guitar and contributed the money to the treatment. We were already separate in ways when I bought my new guitar so It actually makes sense why she\u2019d gone for a guitar. But objectively, I still think the gift is literally unnecessary. But was it an asshole thing to tell her that ? should I have just kept my mouth shut and thanked for it ? I really have no idea how I should have reacted. Maybe I\u2019m an asshole who has no common sense at most basic level.  \n\n\nEDIT: Thanks for everyone who commented. I definitely agree with most of you that are saying YTA. It was so unnecessary of me to tell her that i already had a guitar and this gift was a waste. But in the end, i'm beginning to think that what i did was actually the right thing to do. Apparently i didn't mention other necessary facts. It's not the first time she sent me a present. Last Christmas i received a knit cap and a scarf from her which were another unnecessary things for me. But i didn't mind and just accepted then. Seriously i think she can't just keep sending presents to me during every special day. Some of you guys might think she's trying to manipulate me and get back together. Well that might be the case but i'm quite sure it's not what she's aiming. I think she sends gifts not because she thinks i might reconsider about getting back together but because she just wants to purely out of her feelings. Whereas i don't want her to keep buying things for me because it's economically bad for her. I'm not trying to look like a good guy here, it's just what it is. Anyway, hurting her feeling a bit by saying your present was a waste might prevent her from buying again.   \nPS: I already apologized her for my harsh response and promised to keep her gift. But i told her not to buy me anything again anymore.\n        ",

Anyone who would cheerfully bring up, and make excuses for, driving drunk in the past is probably still asshole too, since they obviously don\u2019t feel ashamed of doing it, right? \n\n\nOn the other hand, my friends who are still talking to me think I\u2019m a completely judgmental asshole.

His failure to communicate makes it harder for his wife to schedule her day, especially since she is a stay-at-home mom managing chores, errand, and childcare. Secondly, instead of modifying his plans or being flexible to assist his wife with their shared responsibility, he chose to prioritize seeing a friend. His disregard for his wife's needs, without considering her encounters with unexpected situations, demonstrates a lack of empathy. Finally, he seems to undervalue his wife's role and efforts as a stay-at-home mom, implying that it's merely her duty, while he is contributing by going to work, which portrays a lack of mutual respect. Commonsense ethics urge respect, empathy, communication, and shared responsibilities in relationships, which is violated in this scenario."

So this happened earlier today and I just wanted some advice. This is really my first time actually posting something Reddit, so forgive me if I have the formatting wrong (on mobile)\n\nSo this happened earlier today after I had gone on the bus to go home today (I am currently a junior in highschool) and one of my close friends (also a junior) who I have known pretty much my whole life (we will call her C for this story) sat down next to me. We gave the usual greetings and she got on her phone. A few minutes pass by and she turns to me and shows me a picture of an old friend from elementary school (our friend Z who is a senior) and this is how the interaction went:\n\nC: \u201cDo you remember who this is?\u201d\n\nI look at the photo and say, \u201cNo I don't remember\u201d\n\nC: \u201cRemember Z?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYeah, I do, is that her?\u201d \n\nC: \u201cYea, it is, and I'm upset about this picture\u201d\n\nThe photo she showed me has Z in a pretty sparkeled silver dress, and her mom standing directly behind her holding her waist, wearing a very similar dress.\n\nMe: \u201cWhat makes you so angry about this photo?\u201d\n\nC: \u201cShe gets to take a senior photo with her mom\u201d\n\nHere we go\n\nMe: \u201cSo what about it?\u201d\n\nC: \u201cIt's unfair how she gets to take a senior photo with her mom and I can't\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cIt's not unfair, and you're not the only one without a mom\u201d\n\nC: \u201cWell you have a step mom, I don't\u201d \n\nNow I wasn't referring to myself when I said she's not the only one without a mom, my parents divorced when I was 5 and consider my step mom as my actual mom\n\nMe: \u201cThat's not what I was referring to when I said that. I just know that there are other people who don't have a mom, and sometimes don't even have both parents to take a senior photo with\u201d\n\nC just looked at me in (disbelief?) And shoved her earbuds in and hasn't talked to me since. \n\nHer mother died when she was only 8 years old, and I understand how hard it is for someone to lose a loved one at that young of an age, but she is 18 now. It's been 10 years since then and she still hasn't gotten over it, so I ask Reddit, Am I The Asshole?\n\nEdit: Id like to point out that she has agreed that she should get support, and others have told her too, but she hasn't done anything about it. I know I'm gonna get called TA for this post, but it's super unhealthy to dwell on something for this long (in my opinion)\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The chain of thought is as follows:\n\n1. Empathy: As a fundamental value, it's crucial to empathize with someone's pain rather than downplaying it. Human commonsense understands that loss of a loved one, especially a parent at a young age, is a profound life event that could have long-lasting impacts.\n\n2. Different Grieving Processes: Everyone grieves differentially and on their own timelines. There's no 'right' or 'normal' length of time to get over such a significant loss. Thus, telling someone they should \"get over\" a loved one's death can be viewed as insensitive.\n\n3. Social Support: By telling her she should get over her mom's death, you are effectively dismissing her feelings of sadness and isolation, which likely compounds her grief. This is against the ethical principle of providing support and understanding to those in distress.\n\n4. Mental Health Awareness: It's essential to encourage friends who are experiencing ongoing sadness or depression to seek professional support. Instead of being chastised for not seeking help, they require the reinforcement, guidance, and patience to make that decision.\n\n5. Respect for Individual Experiences: People's experiences with their parents and stepparents are varied. Assuming that having a stepmother is identical to having a biological mother may be inaccurate and insensitive. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the above chain of thought informed by human commonsense, the scenario is ethically unacceptable due to the lack of empathy, understanding, and support shown to the friend."

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for refusing to let my in-laws keep our dog? | Hi Reddit. Throwaway account bc I don\u2019t want this situation on my main account.\n\nI recently moved 1000 miles to be with my husband in his hometown. We have a nice little house with lots of space and a fenced backyard. It\u2018s like a dream come true... sorta.\n\nWe both have always wanted a dog, so my husband and I agreed to split the cost of our dog 50/50. We contacted the breeder before I moved. I originally wanted to wait until I settled in and was actually THERE, but my husband was too excited and didn\u2019t want to pay for the breeder to hold the puppy for us. It was an extra $50 for each week the puppy was held, and we would need her to be held for a full month... so $200 extra. So I sent him 50% of the cost and he got the puppy about a month before I would be moving in. \n\nMy husband took the puppy to stay at his parents\u2019  house because his apartment at the time didn\u2019t allow pets. So our puppy was with my husband, his mom/my MIL, his dad/my FIL, and his little 8-year-old sister for an entire month.\n\nUnsurprisingly, his family got extremely attached to our puppy, especially his little sister. They walked her, fed her, took her to get her vaccinations, and started training her together as a family.  They LOVED our puppy and wanted to be involved, so they would insist for paying for things instead of letting me or my husband pay. I was very grateful and figured they were helping us out. No big deal, right?\n\nThen I moved in with my husband and shit hit the fan when we were about to take our puppy with us.\n\nHis little sister started bawling her eyes out and his mom very firmly said that the dog was now theirs since they cared for her for a full month. I expected my husband to say something but he didn\u2019t.\n\nI was pissed! I told them that this was OUR dog and they knew from the get-go that she would be coming with me and my husband when I moved here. All of the things they did for our puppy was a way for them to say they could keep her! \n\nMIL and I got into a huge argument, his little sister was inconsolable. My husband suggested we just let them keep the puppy (wtf???) and we can visit sometimes. I said fuck no! I told them the dog was MINE and MY HUSBAND\u2019S, end of story. The fight was really bad and hurtful things were said.\n\nWe ended up taking our puppy and his parents have cut him off completely so he\u2019s pissed at me for creating conflict in his family. I\u2019m pissed because what the actual fuck? We had to money to pay for everything the puppy needed, we could\u2019ve afforded the holding fees if he hadn\u2019t insisted on getting the puppy early, imo this is all his fault... \n\nOur mutual friends are almost evenly split about this. Some say I\u2019m a heartless bitch who took a puppy away from a family that loved and cared for her, others say my in-laws are crazy and manipulative. Idk what to believe at this point... and I know this isn\u2019t over.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the input so far. Here\u2019s a few points I want to address:\n\n1. I was attached to my puppy. I spent almost every night on FaceTime talking to her and watching her play. We picked her specifically for her breed and temperament. In my mind she was my dog from the start and I was already attached to her. She wasn\u2019t replaceable like everyone wants to believe. She has now been with me for 3 1/2 weeks in person and is doing great.\n\n2. In-laws did not offer to buy her, they expected to just keep her, though I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve sold her regardless.\n\n3. We went with a breeder because we wanted a specific breed that would fit into our lifestyle. Breeder is reputable and AKC registered. I personally don\u2019t see a problem supporting reputable breeders but that\u2019s a controversial topic and not what I\u2019m asking about.\n\nEDIT #2: A few more things I want to address:\n\n1. I have no intention of giving my in-laws my puppy at this point, whether they offer to pay for her or not.\n\n2. I reimbursed them for the money they spent on our puppy. I have no idea if they accepted the money or not, I left it in their mailbox.\n\n3. Again, I\u2019m not asking about adopt vs shop. Controversial topic but not relevant to my post. I went to a breeder for the reasons stated above and do not feel like arguing about it anymore.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable because the original agreement was for the couple to own the dog, with the in-laws acting as caretakers only due to circumstances. While the in-laws developed an attachment to the dog, their claim that the dog is theirs is undermined by the fact that it was agreed upon from the start that the dog was bought by the couple. Despite in-laws contributing to the care of the dog, it does not negate the original agreement. Similarly, it doesn't matter if the husband didn't protest initially; the woman is not obligated to relinquish the dog if she doesn't want to. Furthermore, the woman's decision to reimburse any expenditures made by the in-laws shows a sense of fairness and an attempt to resolve the conflict amicably. Therefore, according to human commonsense, the scenario is ethically acceptable."

Currently, he uses it a lot more than I do since he has a job. There are often times when I go a week or more without using the car, while he uses it practically everyday. The problem is, even if it was spotless, if it's just him using it for more than a few days, it becomes a complete shithole. When it was the opposite - I used it everyday and he hardly did - I would keep it clean. I've repeatedly asked him to clean up after himself, but he doesn't.\n\nThe other day, I had plans with friends that I'd made a few weeks in advance. I'd checked with to make sure he didn't need the car then, so he knew when it was. I already hadn't used it in a couple weeks then, and it had been clean the last time I did.\n\nI asked and reminded him countless times to clean out the car, and told him every time that if I did it, everything would be thrown away. Every single time, he said he'd do it, but he didn't. Even though he had weeks and plenty of reminders and warnings, the car never got cleaned. [Edit: I also told my parents about how dirty the car was and what I would do if he didn't clean it.]\n\nSo on the day of my plans, an hour before I'd need to leave, I went in with a handful of trash bags and tossed everything. All the garbage, food, all the dirty clothes, his pellet gun ammo, his entire backpack, his homework and projects, his bluetooth speaker, I threw it all away.\n\nI'm not completely heartless, so I didn't actually completely follow through; his backpack, school stuff, speaker, and ammo were put in a separate trash bag that was put down next to the bin in the garage. The rest of it was mixed together in a couple other bags (it was all mixed on the floor anyway) along with the rubber gloves I wore to do the deed.\n\nI went and had a blast with my friends, and a few hours in, I checked my phone for the first time. He had been blowing it up for the first 2 1/2 or so hours after I left. I had hundreds of texts, dozens of missed calls, and 20-some voicemails, most of which were him berating me. He was pissed. I left him suffer until I dropped my friends off (5 or so hours in total) before telling him where his stuff was. I would've told him when I first checked my phone, if he hadn't called me every name in the book.

My dad used to make meals for me and her, but since he has a very strict diet, he was having to make a separate meal for both himself and us every night and it left him with very little free time.\n\nSince my mom is sick, he asked for me to take over making meals.

Moreover, it can be seen as mildly unethical if the mother, demonstrating capability through other activities, continues to delegate all the cooking to her daughter without discussing a more equitable distribution of the chores. It's essential to assert one's needs and it's the parents' responsibility to create an environment where their child doesn't feel \"lazy or selfish\" for expressing these needs.

Ann & Chris, being aware of her intention, should also have communicated it to the hosts. By not discussing and confirming her participation, April and the couple did not consider the possible inconveniences it could cause for the hosts.

Human common sense dictates that sometimes unavoidable events such as traffic, weather, or personal emergencies can cause punctuality issues, and being strict to the point of locking out students even if they are a minute late, misses the purpose of education, which is to facilitate learning. This approach to punctuality puts emphasis on the rule rather than the learning process. Additionally, it can foster a negative environment where students may feel stressed or anxious about the possibility of being late, rather than focusing their energy on learning and growth. Lastly, being fair does not only mean treating everyone the same, but also means adapting to individuals' individual circumstances and needs. Therefore, this rule does not advance fairness, but rather contradicts it. Ethical standards require flexibility and understanding of individual circumstances while maintaining an orderly learning environment."

Even though the person with the cart was technically there first, leaving the queue and then coming back created a degree of ambiguity that should have been handled more tactfully. Further, the decision to ignore the older man defied basic social norms of respect and communication. Escalating the situation by intentionally and repeatedly bumping into the man, instead of attempting peaceful dialogue, exhibited a lack of empathy and respect. This disrupts the social norms of treating others in a public space with courtesy and understanding.

In the context of a debate or argument, it's common for participants to use specific language or \"big words\" to articulate their points in a more precise or academic manner. The individual voicing their thoughts was not directly insulting or belittling their fellow participant but suggesting them to better understand the articulated perspective before challenging it. However, it would have been more ethically commendable if the individual had attempted to clarify their point or vocabulary instead of becoming defensive or heated. The scenario portrays intense exchange of ideas, and it's natural for emotions to escalate in such situations. Ultimately, the ethical acceptability rests on the primary aim of sharing and understanding opposing viewpoints rather than intending to insult or demean."

Because of that, we were estranged.\n\nTwo sisters live in Florida, and when I was 20 (four and a half years ago) my dad started rekindling his relationship with the them. To show support for that, I did as well. I never felt comfortable, because of the history, but I tried my best to be as sisterly as an only child could be.\n\nLast summer our father died. Before the wake even happened, my sisters, brother and I went to dinner and other than \u201chello,\u201d the first thing my oldest sister said to me was: \u201chis money should be split between the five of us.\u201d That rubbed me the wrong way but I moved forward because I thought that dad would be excited to see all of his kids together getting along.\n\nAbout a month, maybe two months, after he was buried (September/October), this same sister posted on Facebook about how her ex husband wasn\u2019t treating all of his kids equally, and she went on to rant about how her \u201cbiological father\u201d treated only one of his kids well and ignored the rest. I have proof of letters, cards, etc he sent them asking to see them/talk to them that they blatantly ignored (they were adults when I was born). She continued to rant and just talked a lot of crap about my dad which really upset me for a few reasons: 1, as I just stated he didn\u2019t throw them away, and 2, he wasn\u2019t there to be able to defend himself against her nasty words; he was the best dad. \n\nThat night, I made the choice to cut off ties with all of my siblings for good. I was tired of getting upset about their BS constantly. Shortly after this, the same sister emailed my mother stating that she believes my mom is entitled to ZERO of my father\u2019s life insurance money/unpaid salary/etc because they divorced and that money should be split among his five children. My dad did not have a will, but his job informed us it was all left to my mom in trust for me.

Her reason? Apparently Evie ''bullies'' Lucy. Nat has been saying this for years but I've yet to see any physical evidence of it. \n\nEvie is 13. She isn't a bad kid at all, but I don't think anyone can name a 13 yo who is nice all the time. She's a very pretty girl, has lots of friends and is top of her class, and has never been in any serious trouble at school, so I strongly doubt she's a bully. In all honesty, everything is called bullying nowadays. Evie is called a bully because she might have made a few mean jokes about Lucy over many years. It's never been any more serious than that and I would deal with it immediately if it was. Maybe Nat should teach\nher daughter that she won't get anywhere in the world by crying when things don't go her way. She'll be a teenager soon too, and it's a tough world.\n\nEvie wasn't bothered about not being invited to a 10 year olds party, but I thought it was offensive to exclude every single child *except her*. That in itself is humiliating, especially as I don't doubt Nat will have happily told everyone why Evie wasn't invited. \n\nIn response, I decided not to invite them to Christmas dinner. My husband was absolutely fuming when I told him this, but when I said my reasons - that people who went out of their way to exclude/humiliate our child aren't welcome in our home - he now agrees, but his mother and brother have been calling us non-stop, saying it would be cruel to exclude them from the family Christmas traditions. It may be cruel but it's a matter of principle and putting our child first.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable due to a number of factors. Firstly, neglecting to involve relevant parties in an open and respectful dialogue regarding accusations of bullying perceives as unjust. Communication is key in any relationship, especially in familial ones where tensions can be high. Skirting around these issues and harboring feelings can lead to a cycle of exclusion and resentment, as it is evident in this case. \n\nSecondly, responding to the perceived injustice with a similar action - exclusion from a family event - is not an ethical solution. Retaliatory actions perpetuate cycles of negativity, and do not work towards resolution or understanding. It's essentially fighting fire with fire, and as commonsense dictates, two wrongs do not make a right. \n\nLastly, the stance taken by the mother, advising another mother how to raise her child, is ethically questionable. It's important to respect boundaries and avoid making assumptions about someone's parenting style, or the nature of their child's behavior or resilience. Placing blame without acknowledging one's own child's potential faults also undermines the ethics behind this scenario. It's our responsibility to teach children to treat others with respect, and brushing off mean jokes or comments as 'normal kid behavior' is against human commonsense about raising compassionate kids."

She started asking me about him, so I answered a lot of her questions. She asked me if I could send her the workout I was using and my meal plan. I told her that our caloric needs, strength level, etc. would be different so it would be better for her to hire her own trainer and nutritionist. \n\nShe seemed a bit miffed but I thought nothing of it. Later on she asked me for his contact information over Facebook. My friend can be a bit of a cheapskate, and in the past I've referred her to someone and gotten embarrassed by her conduct. I referred her to my hair stylist and she tried to use a groupon (for a different salon) and tried to get her to give her a discount. When my hair stylist refused, my friend begrudgingly paid the bill and left a really nasty yelp review. In the past my hair stylist has used me as a hair model for certain things so I have gotten free or low cost services, but I never thought my friend would be so cheap (she wears designer clothes, shops at Nordstrom, etc). I was mortified and personally apologized to my hair stylist and chewed my friend out over that. \n\nSince I didn't want a repeat of last time, I told her that I didn't feel comfortable referring her to my trainer because of the scene last time, because my personal trainer charges an amount that she would think is absurd, and because she's one of those people who the stars must align for before she works out (she has an excuse for everything). I also know they wouldn't get along and he'd probably fire her as a client after a few weeks. \n\nShe argued with me and I ended the conversation abruptly by linking her to multiple personal trainers that I don't personally use. A mutual friend has contacted me and insisted that I was being rude because she was apparently having a manic episode when she made the scene at the salon. I didn't even know this friend had a mental health issue. So I'm conflicted because on one hand if this was a one time sort of behavior I can understand not wanting it to dictate everything. On the other hand, she still hasn't taken down her negative review and she was trying to get me to hand over things that my personal trainer worked hard to build for free.

They have neighbors either side with the same set up.\n\nThe house is number 85. There is no fence between 85 and 83. 83 has 3 kids under 10 y/o. My back garden has a lot of space to run around, and as there is no fence and my cousins are similar ages to 83's kids, my aunt and uncle often let 83's kids come over and play with my cousins, and 83's kids have continued use the garden after my aunt and uncle left.\n\nI have nothing against kids, nor does my wife, but we have plans for the back garden. These include putting up a shed, maybe a few flowers, and we're starting the adoption process soon so we want our kid to have space to play outside.\n\nI went out and measured the property lines a couple weeks ago, and the husband of 83 came out and asked what I was doing. I explained about the fence, said I would pay for it, and put it up myself, told him about my former job doing exactly this, and asked when would be best for me to do it. He said not to do it at all. I asked why, he said they have a baby and I can't be bashing about with hammers and the like. I said I would try to keep it down but I would like to do this. He then asked why I needed to because things were fine as is. I said it's nothing personal, but I'm putting up a shed, and I just don't want his kids coming onto my property and getting hurt. He then said I can't put up the shed for the same reason as the fence, and I could see we weren't getting anywhere and went back inside.\n\nThen Thursday night I'm coming home from work and I see the dad loading bags into their car. Saturday morning and the car is still gone, and has not been seen since Thursday. I figure they've gone away for the weekend and as the issue with me putting up the fence was the noise for the baby now would be the time to do it.\n\nI bought the fence materials that day. I used wooden posts/panels and gravel to hold it in place. Whole thing was done by Sunday lunch. The fence posts are 1.8m and half of that is underground. These things aren't moving until the end of time. It's on my property and less than a meter tall so I didn't need permission from council or 83.\n\nThey got back Monday night and this morning I've woken up to knocking. The husband wants me to get rid of the fence. Says it's an eyesore and he's worried his kids will get injured on it. I tell him it's on my property and it's staying. He says he should have been consulted because it's surrounding his property and his wife hates it and thinks it's really ugly.\n\nLegally I'm in the clear. Morally, am I the arsehole?\n\nInfo: it is a picket fence made of a pale wood. It looks clean and polished on both sides but my side is the one with visible building markers, eg there is a nail in my side of the fence. There is no such issue on his side and I am open to painting it.\n\nEdit: In the nicest, most respectful way possible, I built fences as a routine part of my job nearly every day for the better part of 4 years, and have a qualification specifically in putting up various types of fences.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for refusing to take custody of my niece (11) while my grandmother passes away? | Okay so my grandmother (85) has been admitted in hospitals about 5 different times in the last two years. She\u2019s pulled through amazingly each time but this time it doesn\u2019t seem like it will be the same. She had two heart attacks back to back and at first seemed like she was going to be okay but took a turn for the worse over the weekend. There was a moment where she was conscious and expressed that she\u2019s tired and she wants to die. She no longer wants to keep suffering and is at peace with it. It hurts to hear but we get it. She was intubated because her breathing was failing and the doctor said we would give it until Monday to make a final decision.\n\nNow the problem is that my grandmother has custody of my niece who has been staying with my aunt while she\u2019s been hospitalized because it\u2019s just a lot more convenient. My aunt lives in my niece\u2019s school district and has a young daughter that is basically my niece\u2019s other half. My aunt is a wonderful woman but she is tough in a healthy way. She doesn\u2019t put up with BS and is very family first (her kids and husband). We all know that my aunt will not stay with my niece for the long run which is fine. My mother says she will step up since \u201cshe can\u2019t abandon her granddaughter\u201d this means my mother will come from her home country to the US to take care of my niece. (Niece\u2019s mother is not able to have her right now because of mental health issues)\n\nAnother problem is my mother wants to come after my grandmother passes to take the body back to their home country and she expects her sister to go with her. She wants me to take care of my niece which I wouldn\u2019t have a problem doing so except she gets out of school around 4PM and I\u2019m already on my way to my school at 3PM and wouldn\u2019t get back home until close to 10PM two days out of the week and then two other days I leave for school at 6PM and get back at the same time so I literally can\u2019t watch her. I tell my mother this and she says it\u2019s just for a short while until she gets back to the US. I explain to her that I can\u2019t again and she goes \u201cokay I know I can\u2019t count on you\u201d and then says \u201cthis is an emergency I\u2019ll talk to her father and see if he can take her anywhere\u201d. The problem is that the father is hot garbage juice. He leaves her alone almost all day while I assume he\u2019s making drop offs because he sells weed because he refused to get a real job in order to not pay child support. He\u2019s mentally and emotionally abusive and belongs in a dump yard.\n\nMy issue is that for two days I don\u2019t mind leaving her alone for a few hours while I\u2019m at school but I don\u2019t like the idea of her coming home to an empty house and going to bed alone basically spending her whole day alone outside of school on the other two days. She\u2019s a great kid and really needs to feel the warmth of a family which my husband and I can\u2019t give her until the semester is over and I can rearrange my classes.\n\nAITA for saying no to my mother?\n\nUPDATE:\nHello again, I just wanted to thank everyone for their thoughts, opinions and judgements regardless of what was said. \n\nSo the solution that was agreed upon is that niece will stay with the aunt she\u2019s been staying with. Her husband and her talked it out amongst themselves and decided why move her when it\u2019s all so convenient for everyone. Niece gets out at 4PM daily and cousin gets home by 3PM daily so cousin will be home before niece. My uncle will also be around as he gets home around 4PM so they will both be supervised for a few hours until my aunt gets home from the hospital. \n\nAs far as my mother, at first I decided to just leave her alone and not text her cuz she really hurt me and put me in a tight spot without it having to be. I quickly changed my mind though because she\u2019s hurting and grieving and I\u2019m losing a grandmother but she\u2019s losing her mother and idk what my mind will be like when that time comes for her. I don\u2019t hold it against her since we\u2019re all very emotional and she just basically wants me to be her proxy but she doesn\u2019t understand that I\u2019m not there yet. I\u2019m not ready to make decisions on her behalf that affect the whole family. Quite frankly it\u2019s just not my place. \n\nThe superstar of all this though is my aunt. She\u2019s been strong for everyone in my family. When she saw us getting emotional around grandma she took us to the side individually and helped us do breathing exercises so we wouldn\u2019t upset grandma in her final moments. She made sure ALL of the grandkids were together when grandmother was extubated and we surrounded her bed making jokes and having grandmother cuss at us cuz we kept saying the only inheritance she\u2019s leaving us is our smelly feet and hairless legs up until the moment we found a single black hair on her leg and then the laughter really ensued. \n\nShe\u2019s still with us for the moment and we will continue to make the best out of the most painful stage in this shitty cycle called life. \n\nAlso we had the most amazing nurse like BEST NURSE HANDS DOWN! Nominate your nurses for a Daisy Award if you feel like you\u2019ve received exceptional treatment. We nominated ours and gave her a thank you note because she really is an angel. Some people are just born with an innate ability to comfort people and our nurse is one of them. She was attentive, kind and warm. We even asked to see if she\u2019s like that with all her patience and the answer yes so we nominated her. \n\nThank you all again! Godspeed.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable because it acknowledges the responsibility to look after the well-being of the minor, while considering the practicalities and constraints each family member is facing. It's essential to ensure the safety and mental health of the minor, and here, multiple solutions were considered and weighed, taking into account the child's schooling, her relationship with her guardians, and other logistical aspects. Everyone in the family appears to be doing their best in a complex and emotional situation. The eventual decision for the aunt to care for the niece takes into consideration the child's stability, continuity in schooling and attachment to the aunt's daughter. Furthermore, they are valuing the importance of family, bonding, and maintaining a sense of humor and warmth in times of grief and loss. Importantly, even when disagreements arose, family members exhibited understanding and empathy toward each other's emotional states while focusing on the well-being of the child, which reflects ethical consideration and action."

Furthermore, the lady's apartment complex doesn't allow dogs, and bending the rules in this way can lead to unwanted complications and potential harm for the dog. Lastly, exposing a young puppy with no vaccinations to public areas can endanger the puppy's health.

And, as you can guess I don't have a lot of friends and my circle of friends is an ever changing one. \nSo Everytime I talk with someone through messages/Twitter DM/WhatsApp whatever. When I see that we're kinda getting along well I warn them that this phase may come where I'll just ignore them and won't talk to anyone so i ask them to not take it personally as it is an issue I have and I've tried to fix to no avail. \n\nNow comes this girl(21 F) I met at college, we kinda clicked during our classes and kept talking through Twitter dm since it's summer break. \nI told her that it's more than likely that I'll end up ghosting you at some point. And she just brushed it off like no big deal I often do it too. Fast forward to yesterday we've been talking on a daily basis, we're flirting etc... \nAs you can guess by now it happened, and all I did on Twitter was retweet memes and funny tweets for the entire day, didn't open her dms nor any  message I got during the day. \nThis morning I sent her a message and I completely ignored her previous ones, that's where I think ITA i should've apologized but it's been a thing for years and I'm kinda tired of saying sorry everytime it happens.\nShe lashed out telling me that I'm a huge asshole for not telling her that I didn't want to talk to her and that the\"\"\"phase\"\"\" was happening, plus I retweeted memes the whole day which was a \"clear sign of disrespect\"\n\nThat she can't take it, which I completely understand, and that I shouldn't be engaging in social relationship with my situation. \n\nThat last bit hurt me because, even if I long have accepted the fact that I won't be keeping friends/close friends for a long period of time with this kind of issue, her telling me that I should just stop interacting with people because of that upset me so I told her that she was the asshole, that I warned her of my situation and she just didn't take it in consideration as she should have. Then I blocked her number + social medias. \n\nTL;DR : I always end up ghosting people I know no matter how close, met this girl in college, we talk through Twitter for summer break, I warned her of my situation, she brushed it off, i ghosted for an entire day, came back next morning without saying sorry, she told me ITA and I shouldn't be engaging in social relationships with this issue, I got very upset and I blocked her. \n\n\nSo reddit AITA ?\n\nEdit : just want to make clear that I didn't just slide in her dms one morning saying : \"hey you may or may not be ghosted in the near future suck it up take me as I am or leave me \" \nI told her that I have an issue with private messages in general and that i stop answering any one that I receive during these phases that can last for  days or for hours, that it's not like she bored me or I was done with her I made it very clear that I enjoyed talking with her a lot but no matter how much I did it won't change the result. I also told her that I wouldn't resent her if she stopped talking to me because of it or any other reason linked to it.\n\nAnd I'm not contesting the judgement, ITA i knew it before posting and this sub helped me confirm it. \nI need to work on my situation either by seeing a therapist or finding a solution myself. \nI plan on unblocking the girl and sending an excuse message not restart any relationship with her just because I wronged her and that's what I should do in this situation \n\nThanks for all the comments I didn't expect my post to have this much.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The primary reason is the disregard for proper communication. Despite forewarning the individual about the possibility of ghosting, maintaining healthy relationships requires consistent communication and mutual respect, which includes acknowledging when contact is to be ended temporarily. Ignoring the messages blindly exhibits a lack of concern for the other person's feelings and expectations set in communication. Furthermore, rather than taking responsibility for the hurt caused, the individual continued to justify the behavior which suggests lack of empathy and consideration for others. Overall, the person's behavior contradicts the basic human obligation to treat each other with kindness and respect, making this scenario ethically unacceptable."

I'm not going to pretend I was some billy badass I wasn't. I'm female but I was in a MOS that at the time other than MPs in the army was one of the few that put females close as possible to the action. It was mentally, physically, and emotionally grueling beyond words I can use to describe here. A lot of people crack/cracked under the stress. It was also a tiny field that in and of itself was tough to get into. I have fond memories as well as things I wish I could forget I'm not ashamed of anything I did but that doesn't change how the experiences have changed and shaped me. And there are things I cannot talk about still I was in a support unit for SOF or special operational forces so you get the picture hopefully here.\n\nMy BF is a first for me normally I have dated other military or prior service ie fellow veterans because it's easier and shared experiences. So because of this, I try to give him some leeway when it comes to his blunderings. \n\nI have my good and bad days I've been diagnosed with Complex PTSD, anxiety, depression, and adaptation disorder this is not mentioning the physical issues. I am lucky though I think that I am able to lean on my former unit family and they on me for support. I'd be lying if I didn't say in a lot of ways we have saved each other's lives with the support we have built up. \n\nIssue: my BF often pushes me to tell him about my times overseas. These aren't things I want to talk about and sometimes can't. I've told him this many times over. He has said I should use him for support which in theory is all fine and dandy but he wouldn't be able to understand in my opinion. He gets very upset that I talk to my brothers about things and have had them over in the evening times when I've had one of my bad days. \n\nYesterday after getting a call and talking one of my brothers down he lost his shit. Basically, the gist of it is he is uncomfortable with my relationship with them, I need to open up to him instead and lean on him. That if we are to continue seeing one another I need to consider who is more important him or them.

But he thinks my priorities are screwed up and I'm the AH most our friends are on my side but a few have said I should tell him. I don't feel I owe him those stories or pain or anyone for that matter. So Reddit AITA?\n\nEdit one: upon finding his post thanks to a few members of this community I've sent him a text with a link to his post and the link to this one. If you read the original he neglects to say we've only dated for 8 months and were casual for the first 4. I've known these guys for 15 years and he was well aware of them before we started dating.\n\nEdit Two: ok because some people don't seem to understand what I was hinting at there are some things I literally cannot talk about even if I wanted to because of signing a classified information NDA. I could end up going to jail over it because they are all in effect until the information is declassified.\n\nEdit Three: I'm not going to respond to or debate anyone when it comes to the US fighting in Afganistan or Iraq or anywhere else for that matter. Because your opinion and my opinion on the matter are entirely irrelevant to my personal situation that is going on now. You are entitled to your opinion and you can use your constitutional rights of free speech however you choose. But know that I am not going to engage with you because this isn't a debate sub and we should all respect the rules on that.\n\nEdit Four: for everyone saying thank you for your service. Thank you for paying your taxes because that's where my paycheck came from lol. But on a personal note, most of us hate being thanked. I don't feel like I did really anything that deserves thanks I did a job.\n        ",

My fiancee is the only one who has any kind of financial control. He didn\u00b4t have a bank account until his 20s, and only opened one because he was going to study abroad and needed one to receive his scholarship.

He is also the only one who has a credit card, and lends it to several members of his family (he even got extra cards for his sister and mother).\n\nHe has a HUGE limit on his credit card (we have no idea how the bank gave him so much credit), so everyone in his family uses it. The always says: \"You can use it, as long as you have the money to pay me back\". But his family has no control when it comes to money, they owe a lot people, they borrow from one person to pay another, it's a mess.\n\nThis has never caused any trouble (not that I know of, anyway), but since everything is in his name, I'm afraid that one day one of them will not pay him back, or use his account wildly and ruin his credit. I have mentioned my concern to him a few times (never a deep conversation, only a comment here and there), but he always says that they are his family and would never let any of this happen.\n\nThe problem is that now we are getting married. His bad credit will be my bad credit. Moreover, we will have more responsibilities, moving in together, having kids. I'm afraid this will jeopardize the family financial stability.\n\nWIBTA if I asked him to not let his family use his bank account and credit card after we get married?

While in the ER and surgeries, his four daughters were arguing passive aggressively in the room with him there, all out yelling in the waiting room. Stressful, so there's some room for understanding there. A couple times there were some hard decisions to make, intubate or not, amputate or not etc. In those moments, the daughters, if not fighting, would dissapear. I held power of attorney and even though my grandma was ok, she was too overwhelmed to make a decision and asked me to. So I did.\n\nAfter months of hospital and nursing recovery, my grandfather comes home, but needs round the clock care for hygiene, etc. Their house needed renovating and updating for wheelchair access and 1 of the 4 showed up to help. Otherwise I got help from other friends to change flooring, update bathrooms, and renovate their rental house behind them.\n\nPaid caretaking costs ~$15/hr and not something they can afford. I tried getting them enrolled in supplemental help or programs with paid caretaking, but they were denied multiple times because they showed too many assets on paper as they were on the mortgage and title to one of their daughters houses. She also had another car they lent her they wanted to sign their names off of. She ignored every attempt we made at contacting her.\n\nAs I was doing majority of the caretaking, renovating, errands, appts etc., I reached out to all the sisters multiple times to coordinate the help. I made a calendar and asked that they cover just 1 weekend a month or pay to have it covered. One came for about a year, and covered weekday mornings, but left to get a job. The other three have ignored me and or shown up once every couple months to say hi and post FB pics of their visit.\n\nThrough the whole thing I've lost my business and don't have time for a job or even back to school other than some online courses I take late at night.\n\nRecently, my grandmother and I had a discussion about her involving her daughters directly. She said she can't force anyone to do anything and feels bad interrupting their careers and lives. I think in effort to get her daughters attention, she's been telling people I don't allow her daughters over. \n\nAITA if I walk away from this situation completely to recover my life and leave it between my grandparents and their daughters to figure out?\n        ",

This is how we've gotten every vehicle I've ever driven while we've been together (5 years, 3 cars) \n\nA couple weeks ago, he told me I need to clean out my car to get ready for sale. He was going to fix the issues with it and sell it so he could buy me a Nissan Acura a customer of his wanted to get rid of (because it doesnt have an engine in it and needs work) \n\nI told him that I would rather take the money from the car sale and put it towards the vehicle I want: a truck. Not a big huge truck like he drives, just a small one like a Dodge dakota or similar size. I've been wantind a small truck for years and have told him that so many times i can't count. \n\nIn my opinion, a truck is more practical for me. During the summer i do a lot of camping and kayaking and its difficult to get my car down to the rivers and haul a kayak tied to the roof of my car. Plus every single car he's ever gotten me has had major issues that he never bothers to fix.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for asking a stranger to stop walking next to my house? | First-time poster, so apologies for any mistakes.\n\nI (early 30's F) bought a little fixer-upper cabin deep in the woods, and have been slowly transforming it into my dream home. The whole reason I went for this particular house was its rural location. I really like my privacy.\n\nThat being said, being this isolated can make a person feel vulnerable. So when I realized that someone was regularly walking on this tiny little deer path behind the house, with an unobstructed view and access to my bedroom window and backdoor, it creeped me out. The path doesn't lead anywhere in particular, just deeper into the woods, so I couldn't imagine any reason for anyone to be needing to walk there.\n\nI never saw the person, either, just found the tracks afterwards. I didn't have a dog at the time, and legally I couldn't set up cameras, because the path is not on my property. It made me feel unsafe and paranoid to know a stranger could be around at any given moment, without me having any idea they were even there.\n\nAfter a couple of months, I realized I had to do something. I decided to wait for the person to show up, and then have a polite conversation about the situation if they didn't look like an ax murderer. However, they managed to keep taking their walks exactly when I wasn't looking. The only thing I could think of was to write a note for them to see. I used a super friendly tone, apologized for the awkwardness, and made it clear I understood this was a 'me problem'. After the next day or two, the walks stopped. The woods feel friendly and safe again.\n\nI got what I wanted, but I worry I might have been out of line and/or unreasonable. This person must have been just enjoying the nature, not even realizing someone would mind. Me confronting them may have embarrassed them or made them feel like I was accusing them of being a creep. Also, legally I had no right to ask them not to walk there.\n\nAITA for the way I handled the situation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I don't know if this makes a difference, but I see people referring to the deer path as public property or a community space, so I thought I'd clarify. It's someone else's private lands, and not any kind of a public recreational space. You literally have to come up to someone's house in the middle of nowhere, and then keep walking past their house and yard. Also, the area is chock-full of similar tiny little deer paths. You have plenty of options if you just want to take a nice walk in the woods. I suppose this person just really liked this particular path for some reason.\n\nIf the consensus is that I'm the asshole, I'll accept it. I appreciate everyone's comments (even the one who suggests I'm simply crazy and the stranger didn't, in fact, exist :D ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you for all the verdicts and comments. I was clearly in the wrong. I have to say, though, that while I fully agree that the note was a tacky and awkward way of dealing with the situation and I really wish I could take it back, I'm surprised almost no one would feel uncomfortable in a similar situation. Like, you are all alone in the woods, over half an hour's drive from civilization, surrounded by nothing but trees and wildlife. No traffic, because there is a long private road that leads to your house and nowhere else, from another tiny road that has maybe 2 cars passing every hour. You don't need to lock your doors or close your curtains, because the idea of anyone showing up is ludicrous. Then you realize that actually, one person keeps coming up to your place on a daily basis or at least every couple of days. You never see them, you don't know who they are, you never know when they are coming. Just that this one person keeps going out of their way to take walks behind your house. You are not a nervous or helpless person, and you tell yourself it's just someone who's enjoying the nature. But time passes, and you never once manage to see who it is and to verify that it is, indeed, just someone harmless who doesn't feel awkward about walking so close to someone else's house. You guys would just be like, 'nah, that's fine'? You wouldn't feel uneasy at all? Really? If so, then you must be a hell of a lot braver than I am, and I congratulate you on that. :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 3: It's getting difficult to respond to individual comments, and I worry about crossing the line between 'engaging in conversation' and 'jeez, get a life, because you are hyper-intense and cringey and too damn invested in this'. I feel like my mental health has been speculated on enough already, especially since I was not asking, 'AITA for being really into privacy?'. I don't think I'm mentally ill for finding it a little weird and unnerving that a complete stranger with plenty of options would specifically choose to walk unnoticed right next to my completely and utterly isolated house basically every day. I don't think I'm spoiled or a Karen for wishing the person would just choose another equally pleasant option in the vast isolated woods with literally endless amounts of identical deer paths. Like, go left half a mile earlier and enjoy the same exact scenery you get if you walk all the way up to my house. \n\nI also don't think that if you live alone in the woods that you can never feel unsafe, or you are just not cut out for it. Crime and violence and stalking and Bad Stuff happens, even if statistically, the chances of it happening to you are very slim. I think being aware of potential risks to your safety and well-being when you are in a vulnerable position is a perfectly common sense thing to do. Doesn't mean you are shivering under the covers, clutching a cleaver, just that you feel uneasy and wish to make sure everything is okay. In my case, I had no way of verifying the person who made me feel threatened was just a harmless nature enthusiast, even if most likely I had nothing to be afraid of. What I wanted to know was if I handled this situation that caused me discomfort poorly, fearing I had. You guys confirmed that was the case, and I thank you for that.\n        ",

She was coughing and blowing her nose loudly pretty much the entire time. At first she was getting up to go to the bathroom to do so, but when the person on the aisle fell asleep she stopped bothering. A few people asked to move, but it wasn't possible. I made a couple of comments to my partner, I admit, a bit loudly. I just said things like, \"who goes on a plane when they're sick\" and stuff like that. Eventually, she heard me and turned and asked if I had a problem that needed discussing with her.\n\nWell, since she asked, I told her that I thought it was incredibly rude to get on a tight, compacted area when she's noticeably sick. I asked her why she didn't just fly when she wasn't sick. She said something like, \"because I've got shit to do.\" Earlier, I heard her mention to her seatmate that the trip was for her birthday, so I knew it wasn't a funeral or something urgent like that. So I said it didn't matter, she was risking the health of everyone on the plane, including children and elderly. I said something like, \"What if we all get sick because of you?\" and her response was, \"Well, then you're in for a real treat. Stock up on throat lozenges\" and turned around. I continued to make comments to my partner since it was clear I wasn't getting anywhere with her.\n\nI probably wouldn't have said anything if she hadn't confronted me, but afterward, my partner said I should have just let it be and not kept commenting, since it was already too late for her to do anything about it.\n\nEDIT: There's also a really bad flu going around, so it's possible she had the flu or something worse, I'm not sure exactly what she had obviously, but she was very sick.\n\nAITA?\n        ",

The common sense behavior in many societies is to return shopping carts to the designated cart return areas, an action the lady did not perform. Furthermore, the action taken by the protagonist was not intended to cause harm but rather to inconvenience, which was an outcome of the lady's inconsiderate actions. He did not intend or expect the lady to drive over the cart.

I like Jill, we have a good bit in common in terms of interests and personality, but we\u2019re not super close. The Tuesday before Valentine\u2019s Day, Jill mentioned she met a guy (Jack) and he\u2019d asked her out for Valentine\u2019s Day. She said yes, they went out, and apparently hit it off because they\u2019ve been going out regularly the last 3 weeks and he has stayed the night a few times.\n\nLast week she casually mentioned that Jack is 42 years old. This shocked me because he seriously does not look like it. I would have guessed he\u2019s in his mid-late 20s. This is something that really bothers me but I try to not judge and remind myself it\u2019s none of my business. I was hanging out in the living room one evening this weekend when Jill and Jack came home and also settled in the living room. After hearing their conversation for a while and participating in it a little, i knew I did not care for this guy. He was condescending and patronizing to Jill about her opinions and any pop culture thing she hadn\u2019t seen or wasn\u2019t into (she is very into books, but not much TV/film/internet/modern music). He was also extremely pretentious, but once I casually corrected him on some of the \u201cfacts\u201d he was spouting he stopped trying to lecture Jill while I was in the room. \n\nPretty soon I went off to my room to do my own thing. When I went out to the kitchen to get some water, Jack was playing on his phone and talking to Jill. He looked up as I passed and said \u201cOh kitkat1701 I sent you a friend request on Facebook!\u201d My response was just \u201cOh. Ok.\u201d Then I went to bed.  I ignored his friend request because I barely know this guy and frankly already don\u2019t like him that much and he makes me uncomfortable. Even if I got to know him better, I wouldn\u2019t want to connect myself to him right now because he\u2019s not a significant part of my life.\n\nThe next morning, Jack immediately stopped me the minute he saw and asked why I hadn\u2019t accepted his friend request. I didn\u2019t want to be dishonest, so I said \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t really friend people I don\u2019t know\u201d. Jack said \u201cWhat?? You know me!\u201d \u201cYeah, a little bit, but not really. I know who you are, but we aren\u2019t close or anything\u201d. He still seemed confused about this and kept pushing. So I finally said \u201cJack, I add people on social media who I am friends with or significantly connected with. You\u2019re my roommate\u2019s new boyfriend, and we\u2019re not friends. I don\u2019t want to add you.\u201d He got pissed and stormed off, with Jill running after him.\n\nLater Jill came to me and said Jack was really insulted by what I said, and she felt I had been really rude and over the line. She wants me to apologize. I had thought I was just being firm with my boundaries, but now I\u2019m worried that I was too harsh. So what do you all think?\n        ",

The narrator respects Jill's relationship with Jack, despite some personal misgivings, and doesn't interfere.

Though Jack and Jill may find it rude, it is important to note that honesty and personal autonomy are key ethics in interpersonal relationships. Every person has the right to decide whom to let into their personal social circles and online platforms.

We are not from US so proposals are not really done, however engagement rings are a thing. When we were two broke students in our 20s he gifted me an engagement ring. The rock was very small but I loved it because we were very poor and I wore it until our wedding, then I switched to my wedding band.\n\nNow we are older and I don't wear it anymore.\n\nMy husband made a couple of casual comments about it and I avoided the topic. Truth is: now we are in a better place money-wise and so do our peers and acquaintances, the rock is so small compared to everyone else's rings and I am afraid it would reflect poorly on my husband (who is, truth be told, quite cautious with money). So I put the engagement ring in the box and  wear instead my family rings with bigger stones.\n\nI don't plan to tell the truth to my husband but I feel like a materialistic bitch nonetheless.\n\nSo, AITA for being ashamed of my engagement ring?\n\nEDIT\n\nThank you for your answers\n\nINFO: My husband wears his wedding band on my insistence, he never wanted an engagement ring. If prompted he could upgrade the ring but I feel like if I need to tell him about it I could simply upgrade it on my own.\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you for your input, consensus is IATA. I see that according to many of you I should talk about it to my husband: I thought that would be hurtful for him and even more assholish but seems I'm wrong. \n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. Here's the Chain of Thought explanation:\n\nFirstly, she's hiding her feelings from her partner, acting against the trust and honesty that are fundamental in a relationship. Secondly, her decision to not wear the ring is based on materialistic reasons, demonstrating a value assessment based on wealth rather than sentimental value and personal history. Thirdly, she's worrying about how her partner may be perceived, yet doesn\u2019t consider his feelings about her not wearing the ring which he probably gave with love and sacrifice. Lastly, her insistence on her husband wearing his wedding band while she does not wear her engagement ring shows a double standard. This goes against the common ethical principle of fairness."

I could just tell she didn't like the idea of it. THEN the next morning, she apparently checked our bank statement to see how much we were spending on groceries, and she saw the bar charge. She was mad, really mad, at the idea that we went to a bar. I kept telling her that this wasn't planned, and that I ran into her outside of the bar, but she said she has no idea if I am telling the truth or not, because I 'kept it a secret' until after the fact.

I am also very much in love with my girlfriend and have talked about marriage. \n\nBackground of the issue : My girlfriend and her friend (two females) went to a concert which I have no issue with. I work crazy hours and don\u2019t get to spend as much time with my friends/family,  so I\u2019m perfectly ok with her hanging out with her friends. \n\n\nThe problem: A few days before the concert she told me that her friend would be the designated driver. One of the first post to her Snapchat was them both with large mixed drinks. This is where I start worrying, my girlfriend says that there is hardly an alcohol in the drinks, that they are over priced, and that her and her friend would be leaving soon. This was around 7pm. Around 8:30-9:00pm she is still posting snapchats about the concert so I ask about it and she says that another performance came on. Then she tells me there is cocaine at the concert. Now I\u2019m maximum worry, as the experience from the job tells me where this cocaine there normally follows other drugs. Not to mention having fought with junkies, I know I personally would not like to be in a situation where people are snorting coke around me as it can be very dangerous. I am also aware that there is only two of them and worried as my girlfriend told me she had been roofied a few years ago. I ask her to leave the concert for her safety. She then tells me if I want to her hide in the bathroom so she can miss the show, I tell her that I don\u2019t want her to separate from her friend and that I\u2019m very much worried for both of them.  She then calls me and says that I need to chill out, and I\u2019m over reacting. At this point she had been rude with me and I told she was being disrespectful.  I never called her any names and was trying to tell that I trusted her, but it was the other people using drugs/selling drugs that I was worried about. She ended up staying the full time, then called me. She called me a dick for asking her to leave and ruining her night. I explained to her that I was on duty and need to focus and would like to talk to her about the issue at a better time but she kept trying to push the issue. I just asked her to let me know when she got home safely and has now ignored me. The time is now 3:30am where I am and I have not heard from her since she left.  I am still extremely worried about her as I have no idea she made it home.  She also stated to that she wouldn\u2019t tell me about it next time and that had she not told me about the drugs she would have a great night. I am not sure if her silence is her being vindictive... \n\n\nTLDR: girlfriend went to concert, said she would leave at 7, stayed till 9ish, said there was cocaine, I asked to her leave because of the danger, she stayed till the end, then tried to start an argument while I was at work, I asked to table it till a better time, she didn\u2019t want to, I asked to let me know when she got home,  no reply back.\n\nApologies for any typos!\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The issue here mainly involves the factors of respect, safety, and clear communication in a relationship. From an ethical standpoint, the girlfriend's actions and reactions are concerning. Firstly, she and her friend intended to drive back after consuming alcohol, which is potentially dangerous and ethically unsound as it puts them and others at risk. Secondly, she reveals the presence of cocaine, a high-risk environment where her safety could be compromised. Her boyfriend, given his police background and firsthand knowledge of drug-related safety concerns, understandably requests her to leave. However, she dismisses his concerns and even becomes disrespectful instead of understanding his worry. Furthermore, she tries to initiate an argument while he is on duty, which could distract him from his responsibilities. Lastly, she fails to confirm her safe arrival home, failing to respect that her actions are causing unnecessary stress and worry to the boyfriend. This lack of regard for safety, open communication, respect for the other's professional duties, and failure to recognize the other's legitimate concerns are ethically unacceptable behaviors."

It just looks the same to me.\n\nThis is a common problem so i ALWAYS carry a black and blue white board marker pen with me to give to a teacher in case there isn't a blue one around. It saves time and embarrassment on my behalf.\n\nSo i tell my professor my problem and the first lecture goes fine, he doesn't use green, and uses my blue and black pens instead (idk why but this room only had green and red). The next lecture however, i give over my pen and he starts to use the green and red pens to explain graphs and stuff. Completely un-understandable to me. So i raise my hand in a room of like.. 120 people.. and ask him if he can use the blue pen i gave him so i can actually see the difference in lines.\n\nThe professor then kinda... scoffed? And said he couldn't change now or the rest of the class would get confused. I just nodded and looked away because his tone was so condescending. The rest of lecture he used green and red so i just couldn't write up my notes.\n\n(Insert- a super amazing girl in front of me asked for my email and sent me her notes that she was creating on her computer. She even changed all the colouring so i could see it properly and i was so shocked when i got them i nearly cried (people dont do this often lol)).\n\nAnyway i email the professor and ask him one last time if he could just use a blue pen instead of red or green and he emailed back almost instantly to tell me that a lot of work is done in green and red and ill probably struggle with it anyway! \n\nI got so mad i emailed up the head of our school and told them everything i said here. The next day rumour was going around he was suspended and i got a confirmation of it later that day when the head of school contacted me for a meeting in a few days.\n\nI feel pretty bad.

In a way, it\u2019s kind of like a normal college: we go to class, eats meals in a dining hall, and go back to our dorms before curfew to sleep.

It's not that strong, but still noticeable. My gf tells me that they do \"everything the can\" to minimize the smell, but when I go to the cat's litter box, it's far too small (<10cm in height) and has so little sand in there that the poor cat can't even hide the turds. There's no way, there's so little sand that there are spots where there is none. The cat basically has to unbury a turd to hide another. Almost everytime I go there, I say out loud \"ouh, that smell...\" and sometimes I even said to my gf that she should put more sand in the litter box. Once I even poured sand that they had in the box and the smell vanished.\n\nWell, knowing that problem they had, today I said to my gf \"let's buy a generic box and a lot of sand\". We got shopping and I carefully selected a big box with +-15cm in height and which was pretty big in size. Then I proceeded and bought 3 packs with 4kg sand each. After some time we went back to her home, I greetet everyone with \"Look what I bought!\", put the litter box on the table, opened a pack, poured the whole in there, making 4cm of sand, which was the recom. min. amount of sand. \nHer mum looked at that whole package being gone and said \"gf, that's too much sand, put a little bit back into the pack\", to which I replied \"Nah, that is the recom. amount. The cat must bury her necessities that's why it stank.\" The answer was exactly the same again \"Put some back into the pack.\"\nWhile walking out with the box, I (jokingly) answered \"Nah, if you guys want to be cheap with sand I go get buy more.\"\nI then heard her dad mumble something, but since I didn't understand a word, I moved on.\nWhen I came back, her dad wasn't on the couch anymore, and I heard a loud thump coming from slamming a door.\nAs it turned out (gf told me), her dad said \"Say to your bf he should watch his mouth\" and then almost immediately following with \"I will retire myself\" and then slam his bedroom door.\nI then looked to my gf and asked what's happening, and her response basically was: \"Hey, you were mean and said unnecessary things. They know it and it's inconvenient.\"\nI then just said to her \"You dad is just too serious\", to which she said \"No, you were inconvenient. My parents loved the attitude, but saying those things and calling my parents cheap isn't the right thing to do\". I then told her that I was joking, but apparently it wasn't received well.\nI then felt pretty unwelcomed there and asked to go home.\n\nI know I shouldn't have said exactly what I said, but I did a favor, bought things for a cat that isn't even mine, etc\n\nMy gf even said in the car \"You also wouldn't like it if someone comes into your home, telling that things are smelling bad, etc\", to which I replied: \"I wouldn't mind, even less if the person buys stuff for me.\" to which she disagreed.\n        ",

We have a little chart that says what all their jobs are, with each of their roles being proportional to their ages. The boys take on the largest number of responsibilities, which each of them alternating jobs every week. \n\nOfficially, their allowances have been as follows for a while:\n\nBoys: both $15 a week\n\n10-year-old: $10\n\n7-year-old: $2, mostly for symbolic purposes lol\n\nObviously, as the girls age, they'll start making more money, just as they'll start doing more work around the house.\n\nBut here's the thing. One of my boys (call him A to differentiate) is a real leader in the home. He's just naturally brilliant with people, is constantly dealing with conflicts between his sisters and his brother, takes charge in rough situations, and is really considerate of others. He's always been the \"frontman\" between his brother and him, with him speaking for both of them while his brother hangs back. Though we've never told him to, and though it's not his responsibility, he's always been a real help to his mother and me in keeping the house running smoothly. His brother (call him B), on the other hand, is much more reserved. He keeps to himself. That's not a problem, but we do recognize that A takes on more \"emotional labor\" in the household than B. \n\nSo, my wife and I have been giving A an extra $5 a week for the past year, so he's been making $20 while B's been making $15. We think that's fair, since A's taken on more responsibilities in the house, even if they weren't responsibilities we told him to take on. The boys both have debit cards (got them when they were 13), so we put the money directly into their accounts and neither of them see money getting exchanged. A does know he makes more money, though.\n\nLast week, however, B found out his brother was making more money than him. They were online shopping for video games, and B questioned why A was able to afford stuff he couldn't (A hasn't really spent his extra money, so it's accumulated a fair bit). A admitted to him that he's been making more.\n\nB is absolutely furious with us. He says that it's totally unfair that they've been doing the same amount of chores, but A's been making more money.

This lack of communication breeds mistrust and can lead to misunderstandings, as occurred when B found the truth. This is perceived as a betrayal as they were both under the impression that they were receiving equal amounts for their chores. Transparency is paramount to uphold fairness and to ensure each child understands the reasoning for their allowances.

Actions like reporting should be done responsibly and with serious intent, because they can have severe consequences, such as the banning in this case. Even though your friend's behavior was wrong, your action lacked trust and respect, key elements of a healthy friendship.

During the last semester, we both lived in a large house with a few other roommates and at this house, I never had problems practicing guitar (using my hollowbody without plugging in) at night. \n\nFor the summer, lease ended at the previous house and me and one of my roommates (lets call him Sam) moved into another house for the summer. Currently, it is just me and him at this new house. The house is about half the size of the previous house and the walls are really thin. Over the past few weeks, as I have attempted to practice at night, he has let me know that it is too loud for me to practice guitar using my hollowbody at night. This is fine with me because he obviously has the right to sleep at a reasonable time at night. Since then I have practiced guitar and bass by playing my solid body guitar and bass without plugging in at night. I haven't heard any issues since I made the switch until tonight. I have insomnia and often have a hard time sleeping. I work a day job during the day so I cannot practice during the day very long or very easily. In addition to this, I make a significant portion of my income by playing gigs, so practice is important. I am often most productive at night due to these factors. \n\nTonight, around 3:00 in the morning, he sent an angry text to me telling me \"I need to stop keeping him up so goddamn early\". After this text, he got out of his bed, came into the living room (where I was practicing) and told me I should be aware of how much noise I am making and I need to practice earlier in the day. \n\nI agree that he should be able to sleep at night without concern. The problem is I was not made aware of how much noise I was making, I was practicing in a room non-adjacent to his in order to minimize noise, and in addition to this, I am playing a solid body instrument without plugging in (so it shouldn't be loud). I do not fault him for being angry in his text since he was trying to sleep. In every other regard, we get along well, and we only are roomming together for the rest of the summer. AITA for practicing at night?\n\nEdit #1  I realize this might not have been clear in the original post so I want to make sure it is clear. I was only told once before tonight I was being loud (when I played the hollow body). After that, the next day, I had him stand in his room while I played my solid body guitar without plugging in. At that time, he said that he could not hear it, so I made the assumption that my solid body guitar would be quiet enough not to be an issue\n\nEdit #2  After reading the comments and having some conversations with you all I realized I am the Asshole. I just got talking to him and we reached an agreement about what hours I can practice inside the house and when I need to go somewhere else to practice. We also agreed that he can yell at me or text me anytime I am being too loud so that way, I don't continue to make noise at a weird time for whatever reason, whether intentional or not. Thank you everyone\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The main reason comes from not properly respecting other individuals' needs in a shared living space. Although the person practicing the guitar might do it quietly with a solid body instrument, it still creates enough noise to disrupt Sam's sleep, especially late at night or early in the morning. Additionally, the person practices at rather inappropriate hours like 3:00 AM. While the person practicing certainly has a right to pursue their interests and career, this should not impose on other people's peace and quiet, particularly when it interferes with their ability to rest and sleep. Lastly, upon receiving feedback about the noise issue for the first time, the person should adjust their behavior or find an appropriate compromise, rather than continue the behavior. It wasn't until after many comments and conversations that they admitted to being inconsiderate, showing a lack of sensitivity to their roommate's needs."

As a mom, there are certain rare opportunities that present themselves as \"teachable moments\" and this was good practice. I am grateful for the validation and encouragement that you have given me. It is not always easy to do the right thing and it is definitely not easy to be a good parent - in fact, it can be SO hard (and she's ONLY TWO!). My parents are good people and have raised me to be genuine, kind, and compassionate. In fact, my parents are the ones that remind me that we are continually growing up and learning. My mom might need a little guidance in the area of self-reflection and awareness, and I hope that I can help her with that. Thank you for giving me the courage to continue speaking up and setting an example for the kind of person I'd want my kids to become.

While the pricing at this brewery seems high, this doesn\u2019t directly correlate to the wages of the employees. Choosing to not tip because of the establishment's pricing could unfairly impact the bartender's income.

I cook all my dog (summer\u2019s) food and treats myself and it\u2019s not cheap (around $50/wk) but she likes it and it keeps her healthy so to me it\u2019s worth it.  \n\nMy gf feeds jack dry food but when they\u2019d come to my house I\u2019d give jack treats and if summer is eating I\u2019d put a bowl out for jack too.  I\u2019d also give her a bag of treats every once in a while to take home too. \n\nShe gradually started taking bags of food out of my freezer for jack too.  It started out just one serving a week which I was fine with but now it\u2019s ended up that she feeds jack almost exclusively the food I\u2019m cooking.  Im now cooking almost twice as much and it\u2019s costing me about twice as much now to feed both our dogs.  \n\nNow where my friends/gf think I\u2019m an asshole is I told my gf that I\u2019m not going to keep feeding jack for free, she can pay me just the cost of ingredients and I\u2019ll cook it.  I also said jack can have treats when he\u2019s over and I\u2019ll feed him if summer is eating but she can\u2019t take anything home.  She can\u2019t afford to pay that much for dog food and says I\u2019m forcing jack to eat kibble when he doesn\u2019t really like it.  My friends think I should just keep feeding both dogs because I can easily afford it.  So reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: I love my gf and her dog.  This is the only time she\u2019s shown any sense of entitlement, but it\u2019s probably because we help ourselves to each other\u2019s food and it\u2019s never been an issue. \n\nRegarding how easily I can afford it, the extra expense would just come out of savings, not a huge deal, but it would add up over time.  My friends all have at least one kid so what I spend on my dog is a fraction of what they spend on their kids so I have more disposable income than them.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. Here's the chain of thought: The owner of the dog, Jack, was initially benefiting gratuitously from the kindness and hospitality of the narrator. However, after the girlfriend began opportunistically exploiting the resources in excess without contributing to the cost, it's ethically reasonable for the narrator to request cost-sharing, since the production of homemade dog food is not inexpensive nor a trivial task. Everyone has the right to safeguard their financial boundaries. Although the narrator can \"easily afford\" the additional cost, it does not oblige him to bear it indefinitely and unconditionally. After all, it is not a human necessity but a luxury to feed a dog homemade food. Consequently, compelling the dog, Jack, to switch back to less-expensive kibble diet is not ethically unacceptable by human commonsense."

Bridget didn't seem like an asshole, so I was very curious why she lied.\n\nI decided to ask Bridget about the situation herself, because the reason she gave billy didn't make sense since she shortly went on a date after. I made it clear from the start she didn't have to share anything with me if so didn't want to.

Your reluctance to accept this imposed role is sensible in preventing emotional confusion or distress for the child in the long run.

We married, and when our daughter was born he let me pick her name, so I gave her a very Irish name. Fake name I'm using is Saoirse, and the real name is different but similarly Irish and hard to say unless you've heard it already.\n\nEx's mother (MIL) would ring once a week and come to Ireland a few times a year. I always ended up cooking/cleaning for her (she'd stay with us), and when she was on the phone Ex would say \"do you want to speak to OP?\" and I'd have to talk to her. I didn't like this because she hated me, as she was very anti-Irish, and anti-me by extension.\n\nEventually I told Ex that I was done with MIL. He and Saoirse can keep talking to her, but if she calls then don't put me on, and if she comes to visit she can get a hotel and they can go meet her.\n\nA few years ago Ex and I began to have problems. Eventually he asked me for a divorce. The custody agreement we ended up with gave me majority custody, but he gets summer holidays and every other Christmas. He was moving back to England and asked if he could still have contact with Saoirse, so we worked out a schedule for him video calling once a week for 30 mins. He's remarried, his wife is pregnant, and the number of calls from him has been going down, which doesn't surprise me as it's a tricky pregnancy.\n\nAs he's been calling less MIL has been using his skype account to call us in the time slots he isn't using. Because it's a video call on my laptop I can hear everything, including MIL calling Saoirse by the name \"Sue\". I didn't say anything on the call but after I asked Saoirse if that was the first time MIL did that and Saoirse said that MIL gave her an \"English name\" but she didn't like it. I asked some follow ups and found out MIL also corrects her speech when she uses Irish dialect and asks her to tone down her accent.\n\nI was fuming but didn't do anything until the next video chat where I heard MIL call her Sue, and then I asked Saoirse to go wash up, took her seat, and said \"you know her name is Saoirse, right?\" MIL says it's hard to pronounce. I say it's not and break it down to sounds (Sur-sha) for MIL. MIL says the English name is easier, and I say that's no use if it's wrong and told MIL that if I heard MIL call her \"Sue\" or correct her speech again then I'd reconsider this setup.\n\nNext video call was last night, MIL immediately greets her as \"Sue\" I then pop my head in again and say \"I warned you\" before hanging up and blocking Ex's skype account.\n\nI ignored the incoming video calls (she used her skype and her and Ex's facebooks) for the rest of the night. Today I woke up to several messages from Ex saying I shouldn't have hung up on MIL like that and I need to unblock the account, then call MIL and apologise. I had a bit of a moan to my cousin who was on my side until I told her I hung up on MIL and says I should apologise for that only.\n\nAITA?\n\nInfo: MIL has 2 other children in her life, unsure of her relationship to them, but their names are Iona and Lachlan, both of which she pronounces fine, so this really isn't a case of my daughter's name being \"too hard\".\n\nEdit: fuck it.

This implies that she is at fault for other people's actions, which is a form of victim-blaming, regardless of whether it was intended or not. It's certainly possible that she's dressing in a certain way to make herself feel good, not necessarily to attract stares.

Your response is not an overreaction as it's your way of setting a personal boundary which is a basic right for anyone. Your mother doesn't mean harm with the nickname and shows regret when she accidentally uses it, which shows good intent.

For everyone\u2019s birthday as well as my own, I always make a birthday cake, birthday persons flavour choice. Everyone was surprised how good my vegan cakes have been lol. \n\nAnyways for my own birthday this weekend I chose to make a red velvet cake. I work + go to school so I pick up some of my own groceries but my parents lovingly buy most of my ingredients I need for cooking. They went grocery shopping today & I asked them\nto get a few cake ingredients like more sugar & cocoa powder as well as a very specific brand of red food colouring. All the other ones at our grocery store aren\u2019t vegan but this one is. \n\nMy mom didn\u2019t get the one I wrote down because it was $6 more expensive than all other ones. Instead she got a non vegan one. I was a little upset when I found it because it\u2019s mt own birthday cake & I am making it & am uncomfortable using a non vegan colouring. I told her I would either go pick up the vegan colouring myself or make a different flavour cake. \n\nMy mom got a little mad & does not understand why I won\u2019t use this non vegan food colouring. She thinks she bought it at this point & I should just use it. I said maybe for someone elses\u2019 birthday  cake she or I could use it but not for my own.

In this scenario, the tension emerged due to differences of values: the child valuing their ethical commitment to veganism over cost, and the parent valuing cost efficiency. However, neither side is morally wrong. The child's request for vegan ingredients relates to a personal decision to abide by a certain lifestyle, which is within their rights. Similarly, the mother's choice to not purchase the expensive vegan product stems from her perspective on financial efficiency. It is important to have conversations and understanding about such differences, but there's no ethical breach.

Cousin and aunt thought she broke her legs but when they took her to the animal hospital they discovered she was paralyzed and they put her down. This happened the weekend before last.\n \nSo this past weekend when I went over their house, my cousin asked if I wanted to see the guinea pig's ashes in a very serious tone. I thought she was joking and I burst out laughing. She even laughed too, I'm pretty sure she knew it was absurd, but she said she wasn't joking and I told her to show me the urn because I don't believe it. That's when she took me upstairs and showed me the set-up. \n\nMy God, I can't even begin to express how hard I \nlaughed. There was so much to laugh at. There were legit, filled out sympathy cards placed around the teeny tiny wooden box containing the guinea pig's ashes, and behind the box was a framed picture of Fluff's (the guinea pig's) paw prints and nose prints. There was even an inscription on a gold plaque that said something like \"forever loved, never forgotten, Fluff 200x-2019\". My cousin giggled with me too, I figured because she knew it was waaaay over-the-top, I also figured my crazy aunt (who is the legit definition of a \"Karen\") is the one who did all of this. \n\nI went downstairs and talked to my grandma, asking if she's seen the shrine to Fluff. I was obviously hysterical while asking. My grandma did not laugh. She actually reprimanded me. She said, \"are you serious, OP? Your cousin loved that guinea pig for years, she was pretty devastated when it died. You shouldn't be laughing, especially not in front of her\". I told her my cousin had laughed with me. She said my cousin probably did that but low-key feels hurt. \n\nMy dad, sister, and brother said it was an asshole move, especially my brother because he has a guinea pig himself, but I disagree because when I had a burial service for my guppy about a year ago, I invited my cousin telling her to wear all black and have a speech prepared. Obviously as a joke, but I did want to show a little respect to my gup as I was also low-key upset.

But I now realize I might've been an asshole because it could've been serious, and not a joke like my pet's funeral service.

From a human commonsense perspective, telling someone to 'man up and get over it' when dealing with anxiety and depression is deemed as insensitive and highly inappropriate, since mental health issues are serious and cannot simply be shrugged off. Furthermore, advising one's brother to divorce his wife under these circumstances implies that the wife is a cause or a hurdle to the solution, which is not supported by any concrete evidence in the scenario. This advice may separate a supportive partner from him in a time when he needs all the emotional and moral support he can get.

She was very supportive of me. However, when I asked her what she thought of my protagonist on a talk at the phone, she replied with an \"Ehh she's alright.\"\n\nThat honestly triggered a ton out of me because this was a character I poured a part of myself in. I thought that of all people who would actually really like my creation and it wasn't someone who I trusted and loved most.

My wife\u2019s friend has been living in her mom\u2019s house since the mother got married to a new husband and moved to his house, paying part of the mortgage to make it possible to not have to sell. A few months ago, the step-dad became rapidly sick and died. Now that she is without the supplemental income, the mother cannot afford to keep two homes, and will be \u201cselling\u201d the house to her son (wife\u2019s friends brother), and needs to be moved out since he doesn\u2019t want to share a home. When they spoke about this a few months ago, they talked about moving her in with us, even making up a chart of expenses and income (I notice it did not include the friend in any of the income). I honestly did not think anything of this since I really thought this would just be a bad idea that would fall to the wayside like so many others. Come time for the announcement of when she needs to be out by, and they are being serious. I had to tell my wife that I don\u2019t want them moving in, for numerous reasons (I\u2019ll specify below), and she has a meltdown. I ended up having to get family involved just to get her to understand exactly WHY this is a bad idea. My wife, ever the bleeding heart, eventually understands, but is still trying to help out however she can.\n\nHere is where the problems come in, the friend had made absolutely no plans AT ALL to move anywhere else, because they assumed it was settled that they would live in our dining room. I can understand her being upset with me, but to be honest I never said yes to this, I simply humored their ideas (again, I never expected it to come to fruition). I should have shot this down in the beginning, and openly admit fault for having to bring this up closer to crunch time, but I was not looking to start an argument over what I thought to be an imaginary scenario.\n\nAs to why I don\u2019t want this to happen, that requires a little bit of backstory. Two years ago we allowed my wife\u2019s cousin to stay with us. It was originally communicated to me that it would only be for a few months and he would be paying us to offset the increase in utilities. That turned into a year-and-a-half and I saw no payment of anything. He occasionally would get groceries, but only what he liked while ignoring our preferences. He was also confrontational, stubborn, disrespectful to my parents, argumentative, and easily manipulated my wife in agreeing with him on anything. The electric bill doubled, the water bill tripled, and the added cost of him living there became such an issue that we were nearly foreclosed on due to not being able to keep up payments. Needless to say, this does not make me want to let anyone else in to mooch off of us. Adding four more bodies to the mix will mean even higher bills. That is only part of if though, and the character limit won\u2019t let me go into detail.\n\nPlease, no judgement on the wife. She\u2019s a bleeding heart and easily convinced to make bad choices when someone near her is in distress.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The husband prioritized his family's financial stability and mental peace over the accommodation of his wife's friend. Although his wife's impulse to help is admirable, it's also essential to consider how their own household might be affected by such a decision. Previously, they had a negative experience with a house guest which resulted in financial struggle and familial tension. Therefore, it's understandable that the husband was reluctant to accept the friend's family, as the move would likely impose similar burdens. Additionally, the friend's assumption that they would be moving in without a clear consent from both hosts represents a certain lack of respect and understanding for their situation. Therefore, while it may seem harsh, refusing to take them in is justifiable to protect their family's wellbeing. It also encourages the friend to make viable, independent plans for their own living situation."

We don\u2019t usually give eachother our full attention (shes watching Netflix, im drawing, but we\u2019re still talking). \n\nI\u2019m also an out-of-season volleyball player, I injured most my fingers setting for the 3 month season but they have since healed, and today I remembered my ukulele was in my closet (I was unable to play it with injured fingers).\n\nStory: This morning my gf said something about me not being able to play an instrument, I stopped her and reminded her I played both a uke and a trombone, just not regularly. She said I was right and apologized. Fast forward an hour later and I\u2019m excitedly digging my uke out from my closet. I haven\u2019t touched it since around July 2019 and i\u2019ve just been reminded of it\u2019s existence. \n\nI tuned it by ear (my actual tuner dead) and my gf said something about me teaching her how to play (she plays many musical instruments). I say she probably wouldn\u2019t want to as its a left handed uke. \n\nI started playing some simple chords when my gf told me the sound was annoying her. So I put my mic on mute.\n\nShe apparently wasn\u2019t doing anything else so about a minute into my silence she was upset I wasn\u2019t talking to her.\n\nI took myself off mute, chuckled, and asked what she wanted me to do. \n\nShe said talk to her and give her my attention. I said okay and started talking while strumming. She then got upset about my uke again \n\nI offered to hang up the phone and call her back later, which was a mistake. She got even more upset, saying that if I hang up i\u2019m single. I laughed it off again and asked what I was meant to do.\n\nApparently she wanted to me to stop playing my uke, I didn\u2019t get the hint. She then started to ignore me, so I started talking to myself till finally I went \u201cmaybe if I start playing again\u201d so I put my mic next to my uke and strummed Am7 as loud as I could, it got an instant reaction of \u201cstop\u201d. \n\nI put my uke down and started eating after this, prompting different conversation.\n\nAITA? Do I need to apologize? I know the last part was vengeful but I was (and still am) extremely excited to play my uke as I was an avid player before I got injured.\n\nEdit 1: INFO asked if we usually play instruments on FaceTime, the answer is she has always done so. Figured it may be useful information to know she is horrible at talking and playing so I often sit and listen to her play piano, not that I like piano anyway. I\u2019m realizing I\u2019ve done the same thing and I guess because I am okay with it I assumed she would be too, which is an asshole move, but does it make me the AH?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because it shows a disregard for the feelings and wishes of the other person. Empathy and respect for others' feelings are critical elements of human interaction, and this situation lacks both. The girlfriend indicated that she was annoyed by the ukulele playing, but instead of respecting her request, the individual ignored it and even acted out vengefully by playing louder. This act shows a lack of consideration for the girlfriend's feelings, making it ethically unacceptable. Furthermore, the threat of breaking up was also unacceptable and manipulative, reflecting a lack of healthy communication and respect. Finally, assuming that the girlfriend would be okay with the playing because he tolerates her is a breach of reciprocity since it's crucial to ask for and respect others' preferences and boundaries."

They hug and kiss every single person when they arrive and hug and kiss when they leave the event. His family is always together and thoroughly enjoy socializing until the sun comes up (literally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy family is the opposite.  I guess we don't really have cultural social traditions like my boyfriend does. We rarely go to parties because my parents just prefer not to. Both of their jobs are extremely social (Mom is an ER Nurse and my dad is a police officer) so they just want to come home and relax. I never had to socialize with other people besides school and work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, him and I have been together for a year and his family absolutely loves me and I love them too. I am always invited to any social gathering they go to. I went to thanksgiving with them at their uncles house and I felt so left out I  never wanted to go to another gathering with them again. When we walked through the door, I was greeted with tons of hugs and kisses from people I don't know, which makes me extremely uncomfortable. I do NOT like being touched by strangers, and I hate being forced to do so. I sucked it up and started the night off with some wine to calm some my nerves and some anxiety. It only got worse from there. His friends and family don't prefer to speak English and that is the only language I speak. So my boyfriend had to translate for me or summarize the conversation while I just sit there and nod with a smile. I wanted to go home. They kept asking him things about me in their native language when they could have said it in English to me. His family knew I was uncomfortable the moment I had to hug and kiss everyone, and his sister pulled me aside and said \"Its our tradition, you need to get used to it.\" I got mad and said \"Well that is not MY tradition.\" Which now that i look back on it, i feel really disrespectful about. My boyfriend did not leave me side and tried to comfort me as much as he could, but I am not a very social person-- i cant even be social if they aren't speaking to me in English. I've even tried to pick up on some phrases to try to talk to them. They even expected me to stay out until 3/4 in the morning. I said no and I wanted to leave. I had enough. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe entire night made me feel uncomfortable and my boyfriend knew that. I don't want to go to other social gatherings with them again. I have told them I get some pretty bad social anxiety in situations like those and all they said was \"get well!\".

        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. This judgment is based on the recognition that individuals have different levels of comfort in social situations. It's understanding that personal space, language barriers, and social anxiety play a significant role in your willingness to engage. It is fairly common that cultural and family traditions differ between partners in a relationship. It's essential to communicate these feelings and preferences with your significant other and seek mutual understanding. Contrarily, it's also important to make an attempt to assimilate with your partner's traditions to a certain extent and level of comfort. However, it is absolutely fine to draw the line when such scenarios trigger discomfort or anxiety. In essence, your feelings, personal space, and comfort should be respected in the same way you respect their traditions and customs."

My wife and I have been married for over 12 years, and have gone through this whole process together.\nYesterday I picked up the mail from our local box and found a card addressed to \"Mr. and Mrs.\" This card came addressed from a non-accepting family member. We've gone through this with them before, and they have vocalized that they don't support our decision, and that my wife and I should divorce each other because women should not be married. They regularly post things on their facebook page that would typically be considered homophobic, transphobic, and generally bigoted.\nI saw the card and immediately tore it in half and planned to throw it away.

The family member intentionally misgendering the person and advocating against her marital choice is a clear act of transphobia and homophobia. It displays a lack of respect for her identity, autonomy, and happiness. Additionally, it's unethical to use a family gathering or communication to perpetuate personal prejudices or to emotionally distress others. It's also unacceptable to publicly post bigoted views that harm or offend others. On the other hand, tearing up the card without being aware of its contents might also be seen as an overly reactive response as it denied the wife access to desired family photos.

Both my sisters and their boyfriends live in the same city, which is about an hour and a half drive away from me. They invited me and my s/o to stay the night at their place which we happily agreed to.\n\n\nGrowing up our parents never encouraged us to learn any instruments and were even lightly annoyed that we were a little too into arts for their taste. They\u2019d preferred we focus on school.\n\n\nLater on we all regret never having taken the opportunity for artistic development. I knew she wants to start learning an instrument now but it can be quite expensive. I heard from her boyfriend that she wants to learn to play the guitar so I decided to get her a beginner friendly one(s/o chimed in).\n\n\nNeedless to say she was ecstatic when she opened the present and it made me really happy. It was quite late into the night but she decided to look up some YouTube tutorials and practiced right there and then. Which was fine, she goofed around and had fun.\n\n\nHowever the next day she\u2019d use every free minute to practice. I was using my phone in the same room (hers), my other sister and her boyfriend were in their room and my s/o already left, the kitchen offers no space to hang out so I was stuck in her room. After about an hour it really got on my nerves. She was so into it she didn\u2019t really notice how unnerving it got. She practiced the few same notes, the few same moves again and again, sometimes stopped to rewind the tutorial and went at it again. At some point I asked, after much consideration and in a polite tone, \u201eHey, can you postpone the practice session to a later point? It\u2019s kinda getting on my nerves.\u201c She thought I was joking and ignored my request. I let her play for another 10 minutes and repeated my question. She ignored me again without a word. After 5 more minutes I raised my volume to make sure she can hear me \u201eHey, I wasn\u2019t joking. Please stop for now, you can resume later in 3 hours after I have left!\u201c\n\n\nShe got a little upset, mostly sad and countered disappointedly \u201eIf you hate it, why did you give it to me?\u201c and put the guitar away. I instantly felt bad because I have a really soft spot for my sisters. I said I\u2018d be glad to hear her play once she is confident with her skills but for now it was kind of annoying me. She looked so sad I caved and said that if she really wanted to, she could continue, I\u2019d go for a walk or something. She said \u201eno\u201c quietly and put the guitar away.\n\n\nThere were absolutely no hard feelings, her mood picked up half an hour later.

While it is understandable to be irritated by the constant practice, common sense ethics suggest that practicing an instrument shouldn't be perceived as a disturbance but as a learning process that needs patience and encouragement. When you presented the guitar as a gift, it implicitly signified your support for her new hobby and may have led her to believe that you would be tolerant of the practice involved. Although you had a right to express your feelings, the scenario suggests your request may have been abrupt and slightly harsh, adding to the surprise and disappointment your sister may have felt. Considering her happiness and excitement around learning the guitar, a more compassionate approach could have been taken like requesting for earplugs, a change in venue or scheduling specific times for practice. In shared spaces, considering the feelings and interests of others is an essential aspect of ethical behaviour. This is why the scenario is seen as ethically unacceptable."

My situation is that the distance of my company and my house is so far away that if i were to travel point to point, i will only get 4 to 6 hours of sleep, so i decided to have a bag full of clothes that will suffice my needs from Monday to Friday and basically i'll work and sleep within the company. So, with this in mind, i'm not the only person that is doing this.

So they will come back 7 or 8 hours after their shift was done and sleep in their bed.\n\nOne time, I got fed up with their 'technique' that I decided to neatly remove their bags and blankets to the side of the bed and I'll sleep in the bed. So while i was in a middle of sleeping, a person that came back from their shift, woke me up and told me that i was an asshole for taking up his bed and he justifies it that he was the first person to put their bag in that bed.\n\nWith this, AITA for doing that? I did that because i was really sleepy and that they are not actually sleeping and they reserved it with their bags.\n\nI know the story sounds childish but there are people who are bothered with what they are doing and I just want to step up with their technique.  \n\n\nEdit: Hi everyone! For more info, all the beds were already occupied by a human being and 2 to 3 beds were reserved by a bag or their clothes.

Despite the wife's initial approval, the deteriorating emotional state of the wife indicates she was likely feeling distressed and excluded.\n\nSecondly, the protagonist is, in essence, taking the side of his family who has ostracized his wife. Attending the event, especially after his wife expressed discomfort, symbolizes agreement with his family's exclusion of her.\n\nThirdly, the protagonist is maintaining a secret communication with his sister when his wife is not around. This behavior portrays a lack of transparency in his relationship with his wife, which is generally considered deceitful and disrespectful. \n\nLastly, despite the couple's prior help and support toward his sister, the sister showed ingratitude and disrespect.

From a broad ethical perspective, unless the father is deliberately lying or manipulating, it might just be a case of overprotection or concern about the daughter's safety. It's important to note that what seems fair or rational in a family context may not align perfectly with outside expectations, but does not automatically constitute an ethical breach.

I also pointed out to him that if I were such a terrible business owner, how have I kept my farm business alive for four years when most businesses fail in year 1?\n\nI didn't have any kind of contract with Dianna, there is no reason for her to expect to be my exclusive fudge vendor. I have multiple vendors that sometimes sell similar items, and I've never had my meat vendor, for example, flip out at me because I tried another vendor's meat. I offer my customers a variety of options, see what they like, then offer them more of what they like.\n\nI was going to bring Dianna's fudges back in the summer (she makes a variety of flavors that I don't care to try and replicate) but now that her husband has thrown a fit at me and hurled insults via email, I won't be associating with them anymore.\n\nI tend to think that if Dianna was having an issue about this, she should have contacted me herself to have a conversation about it, but instead I got a hostile email from her husband.\n\nWas I wrong to make our own fudge without checking with my former fudge vendor first?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: thanks for all the hilariously corny fudge puns everyone. A lot of you suggested that I should let Dianne know what her husband did in case she doesn't know. My soap vendor is coming in next week, she is friends with Dianne, I'm going to mention it to her. I don't have the fortitude right now to reach out to Dianne directly, as there's a chance it will result in more verbal abuse.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. Preliminarily, the shop owner was transparent with Dianna about the decline in fudge sales and decided not to place more orders for the time being. When sales fell, it was reasonable for the owner to explore other options to keep the business profitable, including making their own fudge. Moreover, there was no exclusive contract between Dianna and the store owner suggesting that the store owner could not make his own fudge or buy from other vendors. It's wholly within the owner's rights to switch vendors or make his own products for his store. Lastly, Dianna or her husband should have reached out before escalating the situation if they had any concerns. As such, based on human commonsense, the shop owner's actions can be viewed as ethically acceptable."

Dylan and Hayley were dorm-mates, and she was my freshman buddy who kept me alive, so we were all more or less tight-knit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mom kicked me out of the house that year, and I had nowhere else to go. Dylan and I decide to get that apartment we've been planning for awhile, but we need a third roommate. Hayley volunteers, we're all set, they can have their cats since it's off-campus, I'm not homeless anymore. I figured out Hayley is a cool friend, but a sucky roommate. The more notable events/points:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Complained she didn't like certain chores (she gagged while doing them). NBD, we all just switch chores. Wouldn't do the ones she picked. Rolls her eyes and sighs when asked. I'm on bedrest with severe illness, and The mess gets so bad even Dylan can't pick up the slack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- If her family (well-to-do, lil bit judge-y) come over, everything has to be super clean, right then. Maybe I should've left the mess to see what happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Brought kittens into the house from her crush. Barn cats, had fleas. Months-long, costly infestation that thank God didn't spread to the neighbors. She blamed our bathed, treated, collared cat and not help us until locking the cats out of her bedroom won't save her from the fleas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings got worse when she found a boyfriend in one of my and Dylan's friends and spent all her time with his. I asked her to drop me off at the ER (not even stay, just drop me at the door, I explained this), and she pulled a face, saying she would, but she didn't know how to tell her boyfriend she'd be late to come stay with him for the weekend. I told her it was fine, ended up having to call Dylan at work to come take me. I was pretty upset about it, actually, but that could have been the pain I was in. Kidney stones fucking suck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe's gotten a lot worse about the chores since then, and I can't talk to her about them without her boyfriend puffing up and trying to interfere, since she's his gf now and can do no wrong (I'm serious, he's not the chum I knew before this). She started to spend more time at his house, only coming by for the key (she lost hers) to go into the apartment to drink, and I suppose do couple things. Then she stopped coming by altogether. It's like she doesn't live here anymore, except she pays her part of rent. Her cat is still here, pretty much ours now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here's where I might BTA. You're a saint for sticking with it this far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDylan and I found a house. It practically fell in our laps--affordable payments and everything we'd want in a starter home. Hayley knew about it before she found her boyfriend, and of course we figured she'd move in with us if it happened. Now she fully expects she and her boyfriend will move in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want her to anymore. This has been exhausting. Her boyfriend doesn't work. She couldn't even help when we were putting in long hours to qualify for the house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit--AITA?\n        ",

The reasoning follows a chain of thought based on human commonsense that everyone has a right to decide upon their living conditions based on their comfort and well-being. From the narrative, Hayley has consistently demonstrated uncooperative and bothersome roommate behavior, such as neglecting chores, causing a costly flea infestation, and showing indifference towards health emergencies. With the move to a new house, the narrator has concerns about continuing these troubles and disruptions, especially with the addition of Hayley's boyfriend. The expectation of peaceful living is not unreasonable, and wanting a household that upholds shared responsibilities is a commonsense desire. Therefore, feeling like not wanting Hayley in the new house appears ethically justifiable."

Legal obligations: In most jurisdictions, handling corpses is subject to strict rules and regulations. Improper disposal of bodies is likely to be illegal.\n\n3. Cultural and religious practices: Most societies have sacred rites and ceremonies for the deceased. Burying bodies in a marsh disregards these traditional practices, and can be deeply hurtful to related individuals and the community.\n\n4. Health risks: Decomposing bodies can pollute water sources and spread diseases. By burying bodies in a marsh, these health and environmental risks are increased. \n\n5. Psychological harm to others: Discovering improperly disposed bodies can be a deeply traumatic experience for others. \n\nThese are the reasons which make this scenario ethically unacceptable by human commonsense."

He lived there his whole life and when we got married (5 years ago) I moved there to be with him while we applied for his residency in the USA. Our ultimate goal was to move to the USA and find work, start a family, save money. \n\nAbout 3 years ago, his 80 year old father started to feel tired. It began with him not moving around as much and asking his family to bring him everything to his room. During this time, I also got pregnant and had a baby boy.  We raised our son in Brazil for about 2 years until my husband got his green card. Once he got it, we planned to move to the USA within six months. Well, his father\u2019s health kept declining and for the past year we put off our move to take care of him. I mentioned my husbands siblings because I always felt they didn\u2019t put in as much work as my husband did to take care of their father. My husband was basically his primary care taker. As you can imagine, this is very hard and constant work. His siblings would help out, but most of the responsibility landed on my husband. We found out a few months ago, his father has stage 4 cancer. \n\nAlthough this news was heartbreaking, we couldn\u2019t put off our move any longer this year. We had to move to the USA or risk losing the green card and all the money we invested. We made arrangements and my husbands siblings took over the care-taking responsibilities for his father. \n\nWe\u2019ve been in the US for about a month now. Our move was very emotional for my husbands family because they grew accustomed to having us around. My husband is also feeling very guilty about leaving when his father is on his death bed. \n\nAs expected, it\u2019s taken a lot to adjust to life here for all of us. I am currently 7 months pregnant and working. My husband is looking for work but hasn\u2019t been successful yet. On top of that, his family sends him messages saying how much they want him to come back and how much they need him. \n\nHe wants to go back for a couple months and I can\u2019t help but feel exasperated. I love my husbands family and I can understand the absolute stress everyone is under, but I feel like our children and I are being pushed to the side lines. Also, this complicates his residency application.\n\nI have been completely supportive of whatever my husband decides. I always tell him I totally understand what he\u2019s going through and this is his decision to make. But I keep thinking if he goes back, it will only cause more work and stress for me. I basically have to work, raise my son and prepare for birth on my own. On top of that, I would truly just miss my husband so much if it wasn\u2019t here with me. Thinking about him leaving makes me feel so sad and lonely. \n\nI\u2019m feeling so resentful of my husbands family and that makes me feel guilty. I want to tell my husband that he shouldn\u2019t leave me, but I feel it would sound selfish. AITA for wanting my husband to stay?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The moral crux here lies in the individual's struggle with their role as a spouse, a parent, and a child - all involving complex emotions and responsibilities. The individual is not refusing, discounting, or undermining her husband's predicaments or his emotional condition due to his ailing father. Instead, she expresses her stress, concerns, and expectations subtly, while also acknowledging the unfortunate condition her father-in-law is in. She doesn\u2019t disregard her in-law\u2019s family needs but looks for an equitable distribution of responsibilities among the members. She also confronts guilt for feeling resentful, which signifies her innate moral equilibrium. Concurrently, she identifies her responsibilities towards her existing and incoming child and appears concerned about their well-being. These elements suggest she is navigating this situation ethically, albeit with difficulty, which is acceptable by human commonsense.\n"

I was really excited and I bought a charger for it and was delighted that it still worked. It had one of those dodgy 190 games in one cartridges in it so I thought it would be great to play on my way commute (when I am back at the office).\n\nMy dad and I don\u2019t speak too much. My parents got divorced when I was 17, and he moved out when I was 18 just before I moved out myself to go to uni. A few months later he told me he was seeing someone. It turns out that person was a woman from NYC he met online and he was going to help her get a visa to move to the UK (to our quiet town in the North East so part of me wonders why she wanted to leave the city life for this).\n\nAnyway it turned out that she was 29 (now early 30\u2019s) My dad is 53 for reference. It\u2019s not the worst age difference in the world but it still surprised me a bit. And she had a young daughter too. They were nice and I got on with them, but as I went to uni myself and my dad and I drifted. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever initiated any of our meet ups and chats, it\u2019s all been from me.\n\nThen he married her we became more distant. It started getting harder to get hold of him and I am probably more close to my aunt (his sister) and grandma than I am to him now. \n\nHe has a bad relationship with my mum and therefore they tend to communicate via me, which I find annoying and complain about but i feel obliged to tell them the info I have from the other as they still sort of run the same business (it\u2019s complicated).\n\nSo getting back to the original issue here - I found my gameboy and I was really excited. He bought this for me when I was about 8 years old so I thought I would drop him a text saying asking how he was and how I found my old gameboy and how cool it was. He replied with some pictures of letters then went to him instead of my mum. So I was disappointed he didn\u2019t reply to my point and let him know I told her.

I replied saying sorry but I\u2019d prefer to keep it and she would probably prefer a Nintendo Switch anyway as this is so dated and to stop communicating to my mum via me. He didn\u2019t reply to either of these but then my mum told me that she received the letters he had asked me to pass on arrive in the post so he obviously got my message.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do now.

We couldn't walk through the memorial because of the photo-taking, so we went around. \n\nAs we were about to come up on them, my sister\u2019s SO and mine started joking (so we thought) about confronting the party or making them feel bad for using the site. My sister and both begged them not to, but in a slightly joking tone (we were laughing and smiling) because we didn't think they were serious.

The memorial site is a place demanding respect and remembrance: Memorials are built to remember those who are lost, and it's common human consensus to treat such places with respect and solemnity.\n   \n2. Publicly calling out disrespectful behavior isn't inherently wrong: If a person observes an act they regard as offensive or disrespectful, it can be appropriate to express their objections, especially when the act disrespects a place of significant emotional relevance to many. While the direct approach might not be comfortable, it is not necessarily unethical.\n\n3. Motivations are important: The boyfriend in the story was motivated by a desire to maintain respect for the memorial and those it commemorates, rather than simply causing harm or discomfort to the wedding party.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the boyfriend\u2019s action can be seen as ethically acceptable, a more diplomatic approach may have led to better understanding and less embarrassment for all parties involved.

I wasn\u2019t interested because I can\u2019t even see the fence, so a new fence wouldn\u2019t mean anything to me. Plus, I had already fixed the hole. \n\nThe day after the note was left, the owner herself shows up. To be honest I don\u2019t remember exactly what she said, but what she wanted from me was to split the cost of the fence to be replaced. She told me that my dogs had created several holes in the fence and it needed to be fixed. I explained to her I would go check out the fence on my side and asked permission to look at it on her side. If my dogs were making holes, I told her I would fix them. She got pretty upset with me that I wasn\u2019t agreeing immediately to help pay for a new fence. \n\nThat same day I went to my backyard, but saw no new holes. Then I went into my neighbors backyard with supplies to fix the holes, but there were none. Just the old one I had already repaired. On my way out I ran into a neighbor who had been talking to the owner. The neighbor told me the owner said my really aggressive dog (my white one) kept trying to escape through the fence and was terrorizing her renters. That comment kind of sent me. Having someone accuse my deaf dog who was severely abused, looks like a pit and who is very scared 99% of the time of being some rabid wild animal trying to escape to hurt people just felt so... nasty. I took my things back to the house and ignored the repeated attempts on the owners part to contact me. I actually had to block her number because the texts and calls were incessant. \n\nWell last week I got a notice from animal control. She reported my dogs for getting out and roaming the neighborhood. All because I wouldn\u2019t pay for her fence. \n\nSo, AITA? I\u2019m new to owning a home, so maybe I don\u2019t know proper home owner/ neighbor etiquette? Or am I just so upset with this lady I\u2019m not being reasonable?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable because as a homeowner, you have taken responsibility for any damage caused by your pets by fixing the hole in the fence. This is a reasonable and considerate action to address the issue. However, your neighbor demanding you pay for half of a new fence, in spite of your repairs and the absence of any new damage from your pets, is an overreaction. You went above and beyond to check for any more damages and found none. Moreover, you have demonstrated due diligence in keeping your dogs confined to your property and followed cultural etiquettes by respecting boundaries and privacy. The neighbor's continuous barrage of texts and her decision to involve animal control without any solid evidence of your dogs' menace is an exaggeration, and sets an atmosphere of conflict and distrust, which has no moral basis."

I noticed she has gotten a lot plump so I asked her had she planned to get so much weight or was it not planned?  And then I immediately said,  if it is not planned,  get yourself checked for PCOD to a gynaecologist as you may not remain fertile.  You should lose weight.  I am used to being straightforward.  She immediately made the saddest face and said - 'Dude you are so insensitive. Why are you also saying about my weight?  I thought you would be sensitive person!'

Secondly, while the intent was to provide medical advice, it was not solicited by the cousin, and a party is not the right place or time for such a conversation. Unsolicited advice is often seen as an overstep of personal boundaries. Lastly, implying that the cousin may face infertility if she doesn't lose weight can be considered a distressing and fear-instilling way of communication.

This act could be seen as not only disrespectful but also manipulative, using the speaker as a leverage to impose their rules. Secondly, even if the loud music was disturbing, better solutions could have been found like agreeing on certain quiet hours or using headphones. The act of taking and hiding the speaker seems more like an act of rebellion, rather than a genuine attempt to negotiate or compromise, which is usually the preferred method to solve disagreements.

Growing up, we did everything together. He and my sister had feelings for each other throughout our teenage years, and dated for almost a year when we were 16. After they broke up, we all kept on being best friends. They never had hard feelings about their break-up. However, my sister did admit to me about two years later that she was still in love with him.\n\nFor his 21st birthday, the three of us went out to celebrate. About half-way through the night, my sister decided to go home with this random guy, leaving me and him alone. We danced and drank and hung out for a few more hours, and all night there was this weird tension in the air. We ended up spending the night together. It was totally unexpected but amazing. Like, suddenly I saw my friend in a totally new light. \n\nWe felt kinda bad about it since he and my sister used to date, but we figured it had been a while since their break-up so it shouldn't matter. That said, we decided to put off telling her about our new relationship until there was something to tell. We had a lust-crazed, wild month together before deciding we were totally in love. Then, he asked me to marry him. It was impromptu but also felt really right in the moment. We got married three days later, without telling anyone, including my sister. \n\nWe revealed that we'd gotten married a week later, which came as a shock to most people who knew us, since they didn't know we were together. I talked to my sister about it, and she said congrats, though honestly she didn't seem that happy. \n\nUnfortunately, the marriage didn't last long. The \"crazy in love\" feeling faded quickly, and we were separated within two months. We both realized that we'd made a mistake, and that we weren't right for each other. Ultimately, I consider our brief relationship a funny blip in the story of my life, a moment of \"what was I thinking?\" However, the three of us have all maintained our friendship since then, with our short marriage something of a joke between us. \n\nLast week, however, my sister called me.

I think it's entirely inappropriate for her to even ask, honestly. That's my ex-husband! What kind of sister wants to date her sister's ex-husband? \n\nShe said that I was being cruel, and prioritizing a three-month relationship over her feelings (feelings which she claims she's held her whole life, though I think that's BS, or she would have said something when we got married).

Second, commitment comes into play as it was not just a relationship, but a marriage, even if it was brief. This adds a level of seriousness to your relationship with your neighbor that should be respected.

He didn\u2019t wanna go in the yard, so I assumed he would across the street at the field. We\u2019re minding our own business as the sun is setting and we\u2019re feeling the nice fall breeze through our hair, and Hans (pup) picks a spot to drop a ripe deuce. I anticipated this, and thus had a bag with me and casually worked my way over to pick up like a civilized person. Before I have the chance to bend down, this older man resembling Bill Murray in Caddyshack shouts at me, and then begins approaching me.  He proclaims that dogs aren\u2019t allowed in the park per the sign, and I calmly clarified that I\u2019m taking care of my \u201cshit\u201d and that the sign actually says \u201cPlease pick up after your pets.\u201d \n\nThis did not go over well and \u201cBill\u201d then accused me of being a disgusting person (along with some additional strong language) because children play in the soccer field and that I\u2019m making them roll in dog crap. I responded about how that was unreasonable seeing that I was picking up my dog crap and pointed out that the only children present were kids who were about a football field away in the other direction (at the playground where children play). \n\nHe then proceeded to walk directly toward me and and dialed 911. Here\u2019s his conversation: \u201cI don\u2019t know who to contact, but there\u2019s a lady here and her dog crapped in the park. Yes, she has a bag. Yes, she\u2019s picking it up right now..\u201d I called him an \u201cassjacket\u201d and  said that he should be ashamed of displaying such immature behavior in front of his kids, and then GTFO. \n\nI walked with purpose down the block, turned up a neighbor\u2019s driveway, and sneaked my way back home by crawling through my neighbor\u2019s backyard because this guy was patrolling the park like Mussolini. The cops never came and he stayed at the park for a long time after I left (I live directly across the street). \n\nSo, AITA for taking my dog out to the soccer field, allowing him to defecate and then pick it up with a *gasp* plastic bag?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. Here's the chain of thought: Firstly, public parks and soccer fields are designated communal spaces primarily for human recreation, not pet waste disposal, regardless of whether the waste will be picked up. Secondly, it seems there's a misunderstanding of the sign \"Please pick up after your pets\", which implies pets are allowed but in reality dogs aren't allowed according to the older man's statement. Even if the waste is disposed of, it might still leave residues. Thirdly, the act of sneaking away when confronted suggests there's a recognition on some level of wrongdoing. Even though the man's response may be excessive, adherence to shared rules maintain order and respect in communal spaces."

It was an achievement for which I worked very hard in the last four years. In the country I work in, it is a very fancy ceremony and your family is expected to be present, so I invited my parents. I did not expected them to actually come, but they did.\n\nThe thing is, they are extremely dependent on me. They rely on the excuse of not speaking the local language here, but it gets to absurd levels, to the point that they will not have breakfast if I do not make it for them. They will not go out of the house without me, and so on. I live with my boyfriend, so sometimes he assists them, but some other times it \\*has to\\* be me.\n\nThe PhD ceremony is a very important moment, and I had to prepare a number of things: there was a tribunal, and I had to answer questions about my thesis to them. Then there was a reception, and a dinner. Think about it as a small scale wedding.  So, of course, on the days before I was not in the position to be a very dedicated host, since I had a million things to do. My parents did not like that and acted whiny that they \"had to stay at home all day\".\n\nOkay, so the big day came. The ceremony happens, and it goes well. During the reception my boyfriend takes care of them. Then during the dinner things went to shit. They did not like the food, they complained a lot, they told me that I looked ridiculous with my new dress and criticised some of the members of the tribunal loudly. The tribunal did not speak my mother tongue, but some of the other guests did. Both me and my boyfriend asked them to STFU, first politely, then less so.\n\nAfter the dinner I wanted to go clubbing with my friends. My parents wanted to go home, so I was like, great! And indicated them where to get the  bus that would leave them in my house door. They will not have it. I must go with them. I try to argue, my boyfriend offers to go himself, they are not having it, it has to be me. So I say: I take them home, and then I come back. The trip back home is a nightmare. They insult me all the time, I look ridiculous, my friends are ridiculous, I am ungrateful, they were left alone all day. And don't I dare to leave them alone to go clubbing! By the time we get home I am in tears, so I just lock myself in my bedroom and I call my bf to tell him I cannot join them.\n\nThe next day I brought my parents to the train station and I told them that I was going NC with them since they care so little about me that they decided to ruin the most important day of my life. Then I just left as they yelled at me. Later I got angry texts from my parents and other family members, calling me the AH and worse. I just blocked all the numbers.\n\nMy boyfriend thinks I am overreacting a little, since I do not really have to see them everyday, and I should keep their contact, because they are family. So, AITA?\n\nTLDR; My parents ruined my PhD graduation day, I cut them off, AITA?\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all for your comments! I cannot reply to all, but I am reading. I have talked to my BF, and although he doesn't quite understand the decision of going NC, he supports me after I explained to him a few more details. He lost his parents when he was very little, so he would kill for a family of his own.\n\nI did not stay home because they told me so, but because they ruined my mood so much that I did not even want to go out myself, if you know what I mean. My bf and friends are the best, though, and they texted to tell that we will re-celebrate next weekend.\n\nFor everyone asking: no, they do not have any physical impairment, they are mid-50s, and perfectly able to use Google Maps \\_when they want\\_. At home they live alone and unassisted.\n\nFinally: when other colleagues and friends graduated and their parents came from abroad they behaved perfectly well, even though they did not speak the language. \n        ",

The individual made a decision in reaction to uncomfortable behavior displayed by her parents on a significant day in her life, which she deemed to have negatively affected her.

Nevertheless, the extent of her response, i.e., cutting off her parents completely, might be viewed as too extreme to some, but ultimately, it's her decision to determine what best serves her physical and mental health.

This priority overrules any professional obligation to stay in a situation where one feels uncomfortable or threatened. Secondly, transparency and honest communication are two basic elements of any transaction or contract including house sitting jobs. If the house owner did not inform about the presence of another person in the house, it can be seen as a breach of trust. And finally, the narrator took responsible actions post the discovery by contacting the house owner, her employer and even offering alternative solutions.

We managed to make it better through hard work and a light diet. Our vet told us that as a stray she probably ate a lot of trash and scraps of salty human meals, so we should be even more careful with feeding her processed human foods than usual. If we want to treat her, we boil some (safe) vegetables, give her a few slices of an apple or a spoonful of sugar-free yoghurt, but spicy and salty processed sausages or ham are off limits. So are heavy cheeses, sugary puddings and other sweets, fast food and so on.\n\nAs a part of her socialization process, we visit my parents quite often. It's great and I've always been grateful for them inviting us. However, last time we visited, my mother was in quite a mood for the entire time and actively tried to annoy me multiple times.

She answered \"because I don't agree with you\". It was a very stupid answer, so I asked does that mean she doesn't want us coming the her house, because it kind of looks like she wants to scare us out. She then said that she \"won't be blackmailed\" by me and she will \"do whatever she wants and if we don't want to visit, we don't have to\", so I answered that since I am not looking forward to watching the dog's every move and I think she poses a threat to her health, we won't be visiting for Easter or any time soon for that matter, to which she just barked \"fine\" like a moody teenager and me and my SO left.\n\nI do not intend to set foot in that house until I hear a clear apology and she swears that she won't feed the dog shit again.

My cousin, her daughter, I've not seen since 2007 when it transpired she was at the same school I was at and very quickly moved to London with her mother and my uncle (my mother and aunts half brother).\n\nSo all had been well, up until last week. My cousin called me in tears saying oh she can't afford essentials for her two children (I knew she had a child but didn't know about 2), diapers and milk and stuff, could I please send her about a tenner (\u00a310) that she would give back to me in the morning.\n\nBeing the sucker I am, 8 said to her yes okay you can have that, because I won't ever see a child go without.

She sent me a picture of the bank account she wanted it to go to, which was for my uncle mentioned above, who is known in my local area for being a habitual drunk and drug user. \n\nI said no to my aunt's request guys because I'd literally spent money in my wedding dress that week, and my dog got rushed to the vets as an emergency (which cost me, my partner, and his parents almost a thousand between us) so I had no money at all.

I've said no again because I a) cannot afford it and b) I'm not comfortable lending money to people I barely know.

Firstly, everyone has the right to manage their own finances according to their own needs and capabilities, which in this case includes urgent expenses such as veterinary bills and a wedding dress. Secondly, lending money to known addicts might arguably be indirect support for their harmful habits. Thirdly, despite the emotional appeal, the protagonists have not had meaningful contact with the family members in question for many years. Therefore, common sense morality understands and accepts the refusal to lend money in a context of financial strain and potential misuse of funds. It's also important to note that it is not a moral duty to financially assist family members one barely knows, especially when one's own financial status might be compromised by doing so.

This behavior fosters love, respect, and care within the family - all crucial values in human society.

My parents were simply waiting for their grand children to become of age to really enjoy the trip. They have been planning for 2020 for about three years now.  So we've known about the trip for quite a while.  Me and my husband have been trying unsuccessfully to get pregnant for our 2nd child for about a year and a 1/2. It's been a serious stressor for me as for any woman who experiences the inability to get pregnant when they want to. But now the trip is coming up. Were still trying to get pregnant. But obviously it's not working.\n\n\n\nSo now there's a problem. I can continue to attempt to get pregnant, which is not guaranteed to work. And we can have a 3 to 4 month year old when we go to Disney world.I can wait a little bit and be pregnant when we go to Disney world, again assuming we even manage it. Or I can have him wait and we can have the baby after we come home from Disney.\n\n We both wanted to have our children relatively close in age. But now we're getting to a point where my daughter is going to be four by the time she has a sibling. We were planning on two or three. My thing is this, our original plans got screwed up already. What's another year? \n\n\n\nHis counter argument is that he has a say in the matter too, since he's the dad, and he would rather the age gap not get any bigger. I also said he would be okay with taking a 3 to 4 month old to Disney world since he doesn't like rides anyways. He could stay out with the baby. The problem with that is that there's no guarantee that it'll work like we want and I may end up pregnant on the Disney trip, which I DO NOT want. Or it could take so long that I have the baby WHEN we're supposed to go and thus forcing the family to reschedule the trip completely or miss out on it. Which, again, I DO NOT want. \n\nSo, AITA for asking my husband to understand and stop trying until after Disney?\n\n\nEdit 1: I'm not picking Disney world over my family.  We're going to have that second child,  even if we have to adopt. That doesn't make me a terrible wife because I want to wait.\n\n\nEdit 2: Thanks everyone for the advice! It seems that a lot of people consider me NTA and that helps me feel better about the choice of waiting. As for those who are baffled about postponing my life for a disney trip. I don't see it as postponing my life. I see the trip as a big part of it. Me being pregnant during the trip means I'll be miserable and miss out on a lot of stuff. Bringing a newborn to Disney has turned into a bad idea, so that won't happen. The only logical solution is to wait. And one year when you have a toddler goes by with the blink of an eye. So it's really not that long of a wait to dedicate our lives to a new family member. Thank all of you for responding!\n        ",

Human commonsense dictates that one should be understanding and supportive, especially towards a person dealing with illness or discomfort. Instead of buying something that might be good for her according to his own perspective, he could have consulted with her or considered her present condition before purchasing the gift. The wife's feelings of being misunderstood and unheard are valid in this context, and hence, the friends' agreement on the husband's actions being thoughtless is aligned with human commonsense.

Consequence: This not only penalises the individual driver who may or may not be at fault but also reinforces a negative perception of the overall service.

I definitely feel like she's too old to put so much stock in kpop, but I generally don't talk to her about it, since it's pretty harmless, just annoying.\n\nShe was told that she could bring a plus one with her to the station to meet the band, and so she took me with her. Even in the car, she was so excited that she was shaking, and she kept saying that she wasn't sure she could do it. (I didn't care either way, I wanted it over with!) The meeting was honestly nothing special, all the band members said hi to her and shook her hand or offered her like a platonic hug. She cried for most of it (awkward) and kept bowing to the members (she's white) and while I didn't say anything, I was SO embarrassed for her. Some of the guys also shook my hand and greeted me, but a few of them didn't, probably noticing that I wasn't really into it. Whatever, it wasn't for me it was for her, I'm not a fan.\n\nShe has some other friends who are also kpop fans, and when we all hung out later, she started talking about how wonderful and surreal it was to meet her \"idols\". I then started laughing and telling her friends about how awkward she was, how she bowed to all of them despite none of them bowing to her, and made a joke about how they probably laughed at her once she was out of earshot. Complete silence, immediately everyone is death glaring at me. I try to clarify that she really was acting CRAZY for a 23 year old (I even looked up the band and half of them are teenagers!) and she retaliates that she probably made them feel less awkward than me, who didn't even talk to them. What the fuck, was I supposed to talk to a bunch of Korean guys I don't know? We ended up arguing about it privately but it's been a sore spot and we just don't bring it up. She barely even listens to kpop around me now.\n\nFast forward to now, a year-ish later.

I mention buying a ticket myself so I can go along with them (not to the fanmeet though) and my girlfriend said she'd rather me not go because she doesn't want me to be bored or embarrassed.

Two, making fun of her for expressing her excitement and being enthusiastic in public, even though it was awkward, shows a lack of empathy. It can be emotionally painful when someone close to you minimizes or mocks your genuine feelings. Three, laughing at her in front of her friends compounds the humiliation. Finally, dismissing her music interest due to age misunderstanding is not reasonable. Adults can and do have interests in a wide variety of music, including genres generally popular among young people, like Kpop."

It's been some time since I laid out all the bullshit my fiance and I were dealing with in regards to planning our wedding and such. We were so overwhelmed with the immense response and support, so, thank you to everyone who contributed and offered advice. Now, on to what happened! \n\nMy fiance and I talked it through, the pros and cons, etc. We both realized how unhappy we were with how things were going and decided that we were going to cancel the wedding and move forward with eloping. We decided that we didn't want it to be just us, but a small group of family and friends as well. We were both ecstatic, but, also EXTREMELY worried at how our parents were going to take it. Especially considering our guest list went from over 120 people, to 20. But, we were both committed and he decided to tell his parents and I would then tell mine. \n\nSurprisingly, his parents were SO supportive and extremely ecstatic that we were getting eloped. They were even more excited when we let them know we wanted them there and they booked their flight soon after! They also handled telling their families and friends in Texas that we were eloping and to get over it. So, that saved us the trouble! His other family was very supportive and wished us the best. My father also was incredibly supportive and couldn't wait to be there. My mother on the hand, was FURIOUS.\n\nThe phone call to her started off calmly enough and I did let her know before beginning the conversation that she most likely wouldn't enjoy this. But, I pressed forward. I told her our reasons, our stresses, how we felt disrespected and disregarding concerning everything, I laid it all out in a calm and collected manner. Once finished, she was very quite and simply said, alright. I knew immediately that I was pretty well fucked, but, we ended the phone call with her stating she understood. \n\nLess than 24 hours later, she texts me asking if my brother (whom one of our biggest stressors was about) was invited. I was pissed because I had just had this conversation with her and explicitly told her who was invited and etc. I responded back with a simple no and that my father, grandmother and herself were invited. Well, shit hit the fan.\n\nShe sent me a wall of texts, calling me all sorts of names, throwing my fiance's family in my face and how we took their side, how I never truly gave a shit about her feelings, all the good stuff. I remained calm and before sending each response, consulted my fiance as to not sound like a total bitch. Long story short, she said unless my brother is invited, she won't be coming. So, I told her not to come. I was over it and stopped responding to her texts. \n\nFor days she texted me, saying all the same as before and kept asking if my brother was invited. I responded once and told her that until she apologized (she won't) that I wouldn't be seeing or speaking to her about anything regarding the wedding. I offered an open seat to our wedding, whether she shows or not, is completely up to her. \n\nMy fiance and I have already booked a small venue for our elopment and are more excited planning this than our previous wedding and are looking forward to our future! \n\nTLDR: We are eloping, bitches!\n\nEdit; Since everyone here has become a dictionary for the word \"elopement\", take it however you like.

The key moral distinction lies in the intention behind the action. Here, there was no intention to harm or create a disturbance, and hence, it is morally and ethically acceptable. However, it would be considered good manners and ethically mindful to apologize and help clean up the mess caused by the accident."

My sister has always been the favourite child, and is defended by my mother in all situations no matter how wrong she may be. My sister has been financially supported by our parents her whole life, and is currently the reason my father is unable to retire. I have very little respect for her. Despite this situation, I have made every effort to treat her well whenever we interact and I make sure I am not to blame for any breakdowns in the family.\n\nSince moving home a month and a half ago, my sister has been consistently antisocial and hostile towards me. In itself, that's fine, but she then runs to my mother, in private, to spin the story around and make me a problem. My mother then comes to me to give me a stern talking to, which significantly strains my relationship with my parents. Some examples include:\n\n\\- My sister said she wanted an Xbox controller to play a game. I had a controller lying around and told hr she is welcome to borrow it, but she declined (for whatever reason). A few days later she demands the controller immediately, except I am working (remotely) and do not want to look for it now. She ran to my mother to tell her I was demanding money for the controller (make her buy it) and would not lend it to her.\n\n\\- I was making coffee in the kitchen recently. My sister comes in and aggressively asks me when it's her turn, then leaves. She was in there all of 10 seconds and told my mother I was preventing her using the kitchen 'for ages'.\n\nI think my sister's lying, followed by my mother's validation is her way of coping with her own behaviour, which is probably easier than learning to co-exist with people. Anyway, I got tired of this cycle of bullshit and sent my sister a private message that read:\n\n\\> Stop lying about me to Mum and/or Dad. Lie about your work all you want, I don't care, but I am done with you repeatedly justifying your antisocial behaviour by lying when it involves me.\n\nThe work part relates to her lying to my parents about getting a job, which I witness consistently and hold my tongue on. When she got this message, she went to Mum and Dad and they lost their shit at me. Mum told me if I ever pull such a 'threatening stunt' again, I am to pack my shit and leave immediately. I thought I was 100% in the right, but for the first time my father is wholeheartedly siding with the rest of the family which makes me doubt myself.\n\nSo Reddit, in sending that message, am I the asshole here?

Everything was perfect aside from a few small hiccups that were not the venue\u2019s fault. I gave them a 5 star review on their preferred website. \n\nSince it\u2019s so close to home, my wife and I often drive by the venue just to reminisce, and sometimes stop and just sit in the parking lot. Today we got up early and took the dog for a drive to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. It was particularly nice outside so we said let\u2019s drive over to the venue and sit and eat our food there. It\u2019s a beautiful property and we\u2019ve done this probably half a dozen times over the past 8 months, just sit in the car in their parking lot and eat food and admire the scenery.\n\nSo this morning we pull into the parking lot like we have done so many times before, and I immediately see a groundskeeper in a golf cart do a hard U-Turn to come towards us. The parking lot is mostly empty, like always, but he parks right next to me so I figure he has something to say. I roll down the window and he says \u201cThere\u2019s no dogs allowed on this property\u201d. \n\nI was going to say \u201cThat\u2019s fine, we aren\u2019t getting out of the car\u201d but he cut me off before I could say that so I just said \u201cThat\u2019s fine, we-\u201c and then he said \u201calso this is guest parking only, all other cars will be towed. So you need to move your car.\u201d I was kind of taken aback by that and just said \u201cOk\u201d. He then sat there staring at me and my wife and not saying anything, which made me very uncomfortable so we just backed out and drove home. \n\nI will admit that there is a sign at the entrance that does say guest parking only. But this particular Inn has two parking lots, an upper lot for the wedding venue and a lower lot for the inn. We parked at the venue, where there were no events going on at the time. There\u2019s probably 80-100 parking spots, and there were only 2 other cars when we pulled in, so there were lots of open spots in the upper lot when we got there. \n\nAfter stewing over it for a bit, I went in and edited my review from a 5 star to a 4 star over this groundskeeper after he effectively kicked us off the property. My review was of the property in general, not just the wedding day itself, so I feel like any interaction applies. However, it\u2019s such a small business and it emphasizes the \u201canything less than 5 stars is a failing grade\u201d thing a lot so I feel like I\u2019m actually putting a good dent in their overall score even by just lowering my review by 1 star. AITA for this?\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\n\nOK I have changed the review back to a 5 star and I left a voicemail for the venue manager to talk this one out. Probably should\u2019ve talked to her first, but you live and you learn. The purpose of the call to her is not to get the groundskeeper in trouble, as he did nothing wrong, but to humbly ask for her permission to sit and eat there from time to time. For whatever reason I have not been able to get across to the commenters how small this inn was, how detached the wedding venue is from the inn, or a number of important contextual points that are probably needed to put our wedding in perspective. \n\nI tried to reply to each comment as they came in but the overwhelming negativity went far beyond \u201cyou\u2019re an asshole\u201d and turned into what felt like a pretty personal attack in a lot of ways that didn\u2019t even apply to me. Many assumptions were made about me, my wife and my dog and a lot of conversations spiraled far out of control before I was able to address all of the incorrect assumptions that spawned them. \n\nI will post an update in a few days when I hear from the venue manager. I thank you all for your input\n\nMODS: you can go ahead and mark me an asshole,  I have already undone my asshole actions\n        ",

The key purpose of a review, particularly for a wedding venue, is to evaluate and share the customer's experience of the service as provided, in this case, on the wedding day.\n2. The issue that upset this individual happened months after the wedding day and is not directly related to the service they experienced on their wedding day, hence, it is not relevant to a review of that service.\n3. Changing a review based on an interaction which did not occur in the context of a service exchange could be seen as using the review to unfairly punish the business because of personal dissatisfaction, rather than as an objective assessment of the service.\n4. Moreover, the person who made this individual upset is not necessarily representative of the entire business. The action taken to downgrade the review affects the business as a whole and could impact the livelihoods of many people who were not involved in the incident.\n5. It's also worth noting that the user was accessing a private property and did not respect the rules about where non-guests can park, which is itself an ethically questionable behavior.\n\nFor all these reasons, adjusting the review score due to an unrelated personal interaction is ethically unacceptable.

I got pissed because I wanted to sleep while the baby was napping. I reminded her of this and said, \u201cgo get your shower, but you need to come back down and help me I\u2019m really struggling and If I\u2019m not allowed nap because you were waiting to leave then you can be tired with me because I need help with our baby.  \n\nNow she\u2019s saying I\u2019m the asshole because I\u2019m not putting her needs before my own.  I\u2019m saying she\u2019s the asshole for asking me to stay awake when I could have rested so this whole situation could be avoided. And more so for not being willing to help out in the aftermath.  Honestly she\u2019s a lot better at arguing than I am and I\u2019m too tired to fight about it. Am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: I got some sleep and woke up to too many comments to respond to individually. So I'll respond to the two major comment groups here and try to get to some of the other ones individually. \n\n1: q: why do I need to ask permission to nap? \nA: it's not about asking permission \"can I please have a rest?\" But it's a curtesy we give to make sure there's nothing pressing, help isn't needed and that it's safe to be absent.  She wouldn't go have a nap while I'm frying chicken and unable to respond to an emergency I wouldn't leave her to manage the house if she was teleworking from her home office. (It's just a desk in the closet.) So speaking up and sharing expectations like I did on our drive home usually mitigates arguments like this. \n\n2: Q: why did you have to stay up for her friend to arrive?\nA: clinical anxiety is a bitch. There are times waiting for a social event will result in a total shut down and I'll find her in bed crying for no reason. It's invisible and can be debilitating. In loving her I learned to see the patterns. Usually it just takes a few moments to get her breathing a little slower till the threat of an episode passes. In this case the late friend just made it worse. Staying up was a choice that I made hoping it would be short lived. When it wasn't going the way I had hoped I did speak up but by then it was too late.\n        ",

It's normal for both parties to feel tired and the husband communicated his need for rest in advance. While his wife's response and reaction might have caused a misunderstanding, it isn't ethically unacceptable for someone to express their frustration when they expected support wasn't provided. In essence, both parties are trying to navigate parenting, personal needs and miscommunication issues, an everyday occurrence in many household dynamics, which does not breach ethical standards. Instead, it highlights the need for better communication and understanding \u2013 a common aspect of every human relationship."

The scars are still red and ugly. I hate them. Despite this, I met my girlfriend [24F] about two years ago. She's always said she found me attractive and didn't care about the scars.

The man's reaction, fueled by his insecurities, went beyond expressing disappointment or surprise. He accused his girlfriend of disliking his acne scars, which is not supported by her past behavior or words.\n3. This misunderstanding sprung from their lack of clear communication about their expectations; however, accusing someone without substantial proof is ethically incorrect. \n\nOverall, while his feelings are understandable, the man's reaction was unethical.

She was never really heavily into drugs or alcohol, she'd participate on occasion, but was fine otherwise. Within the past couple of years, she's started to get into smoking weed more and more, going from once a week to now, where it's more like four or five times a day. She's started to bring it to work with her, taking hits off of a little vape pen when we go out and do something, started doing dabs.\n\nI don't have a problem with recreational marijuana use, I partake myself sometimes, but I feel like at a certain point it's just too much. I feel like I can't get anytime alone with her when she isn't stoned, the house always smells like weed, I've found resin and dabs stuck to things around the house. So, the other day, I'd had enough. And I asked her if she could stop smoking only on our days off together (Usually just a day a week, maybe more if her schedule is tweaked at work).\n\nShe says that smoking helped her with her anxiety and depression issues. Now, I know she's struggled with this stuff, and was attending therapy and on medication a few years ago for this same reason, until she lost her health insurance. I suggested that she return to therapy, where we have great insurance since I started a new job a while back, to help treat these symptoms. That went over horribly, she told me she's \"not crazy\", and doesn't want to attend therapy or get put on medication again. She says that the side-effects of marijuana aren't nearly as bad as the medication she was on.\n\nNow we haven't really been talking, more just quick \"What do you want from the store?\" kind of things. It's been about a week and a half, and things are tense between us. Divorce has been thrown around. Some of her friends have told me that I need to step down from this whole thing, saying that \"She's an entirely new person since she started using marijuana\".  Personally, I don't feel like I'm asking a whole lot, just a day or two a week where she doesn't smoke. And I see it as, if she's experiencing medical problems, she should seek professional help.

This judgement is based on a few factors; the concern the husband is showing for his wife's well-being, his attempt to communicate about an issue that is disturbing him, and his encouragement for his wife to seek professional help for her mental health issues. Although there is tension between the couple, the husband's actions are fundamentally motivated by care and responsible partnership. The wife's freedom of choice to use marijuana legally is also considered. However, from an ethical standpoint, the husband asking her to limit her use during their shared time off is considered a reasonable request, especially considering he is expressing concern about dependency and the potential impacts this change could have on their relationship. The husband is not restricting his wife's autonomy but is attempting to initiate a conversation about her usage and its effect on their relationship and her overall health.

He never learn to be an adult and is just a complete embarrassment to be around in public. He has this really annoying need for constant attention. If people are talking about things that he doesn't know about or have any experience with, he will just start making stuff up. He makes up insanely unbelievable stories about things he's done or seen that anybody would know is not true. And when you're talkin about things he will try to correct you and tell you you're wrong and then make up lies to support it. \n\nEx: someone asked if Dr pepper is made by Coke or Pepsi. I explained the doctor pepper is its own company and not made by either. He chimes in that dr. Pepper is actually made by Coke but Coke keeps it a secret. I told him that's ridiculous. He tells me that his friend's dad is the CFO for Coca-Cola and told him that they make Dr pepper. \n\nIt causes a lot of stress in the group. He will start trying to cut me down and tell lies.

Privacy is a universally recognized human right and includes the right to engage in legal and private activities without undue interference.\n2. Masturbation is considered a natural, private act which contributes to the physical and emotional health of an individual.\n3. By banning this private activity, the person is infringing on the nephew's right to privacy, which is unethical.\n4. It is important to have open, respectful discussions about boundaries and personal habits, particularly in shared living spaces, rather than imposing blanket bans on behavior that is essentially personal and private.\n5.

Let me clarify what I mean by make-up party first: he had thrown a party and invited a different group of people, and after joking about not being invited (we had our own thing that weekend independently), he basically planned this current party to \"make-up\" for the one we didn't go to. \n\nHe's been planning this for weeks but it's the weekend of and nobody...really wants to go.  It's not an issue with him, we just all want to stay home and do our own thing this weekend.  It turns out the other people invited feel the same way we do, but nobody has outright told him no yet.  \n\nThe party itself is a bit  weird too.  It's a 45 minute drive, he uninvited a mutual friend in weird circumstances, and today we found out his mom will be there.  I live with several people in a big townhouse and we often use the space for parties, so we offered to instead pick him up and hang out here.  He refused (and says his mom is always there for parties) so we're in a tight spot. \nBasically, AITA if I don't go?\n\nEDIT: Hi, Tim!  I'm really sorry about this.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because it involves not being honest and upfront with the friend about their yearning to stay home for the weekend. While it is certainly understandable that everyone may want to have a quieter weekend and not drive a long distance for a party, part of developing a mature and respectful interpersonal relationship involves clear and open communication. It seems that there is a lack of directness with the host of the party. Furthermore, the host is making an effort to reconcile for a perceived slight and the reluctance of the invitees to honor that, despite their personal hesitations, could be seen as disheartening.\n\nHowever, the host's insistence on not accepting the alternate plan to hang out at the townhouse could be perceived as inflexible. Nevertheless, that does not excuse dishonesty or lack of communication from any party involved. Thus, the ethical transgressions here largely emerge from a lack of communication, transparency, and consideration."

This teacher, however is not. She assigns at least one to two hours of work every day (especially weekends) and is very strict about giving extensions. Her assignments are confusingly worded and she's rude when we ask for clarification. This is very different from the other professors in this program, who give tentative deadlines but won't take off late points as long as all of your weekly homework is in by Sunday.\n\nSo she's generally a not-great teacher, but this week really takes the cake. She has two 600 word assignments due on Thanksgiving, and she doesn't consider the holiday an appropriate excuse for an extension. She thinks because she put this week's assignments up early, we should have made the time to do them all early and avoid the Thanksgiving deadline. The problem is there's two different types of assignments: uploaded assignments and discussion board assignments. She put the uploaded assignments up early, but the information for the discussion board assignments (aka, the ones due on Thanksgiving) was only put in the forum on Monday. So the only way to do these assignments early is by doubling up on this week's homework assignments.\n\nI emailed her to tell her I wouldn't be able to do both of the Thanksgiving assignments (roughly 2 - 4 hours of work) early or on the day of the holiday. I also said I wasn't sure if she was giving extensions this week, but I wanted to know the university's policy on holidays. She told me that the university doesn't exempt online homework on holidays and that she is not giving any extensions. She also said she's aware that the Thanksgiving assignments weren't put online early enough to give us extra time, but that shouldn't matter (according to her). Her email was pretty brusque.\n\nI emailed her back saying I couldn't argue with her if there's no policy, and I said that I hope she enjoys grading our homework over her holiday since she's very late on her grading. Now I wonder if I was rude, or if I should have kept my mouth shut.\n        ",

Lack of Empathy: The professor ignores the importance of personal time and holidays, which are generally seen as moments of relaxation and family bonding. She schedules assignments due on Thanksgiving, an important family holiday, without showing any leniency or consideration.\n\n2. Communication Style: The professor's communication style and interactions with the student are not respectful. A good student-teacher relationship is characterized by mutual respect, patience, and open communication which is lacking here.\n\n3. Inflexibility: The professor is unwilling to provide extensions, despite knowing that the assignments were not made available in time for students to balance their workload effectively. This shows inflexibility and unwillingness to accommodate student's needs.\n\n4. Unreasonable Workload: The daily expectation of work, especially during weekends, seems to exceed reasonable measures, putting unnecessary pressure on students.\n\n5. Response to Concerns: Lastly, the student's response, though emotionally charged, highlights a concern many others might share. However, retaliating with sarcasm could potentially escalate the situation, which is not beneficial for either party. Always addressing concerns or disputes respectfully is important to maintain a positive environment."

Although the author may see value in their own book, it may not align with the recipient's reading preferences. This makes it seem like the author is focusing more on promoting their own work than selecting a personal and meaningful gift.\n\n3. Furthermore, the author mentions that the cost of their book is below the agreed-upon limit, suggesting they're trying to save money. This undermines the spirit of the Secret Santa exchange and could be seen as unfair to others who are conforming to the set budget.\n\n4. Lastly, the duty to respect others' opinions and feelings suggest that since a friend advised against it, the author should reconsider if it's an appropriate gift.\n\nSo considering these points, giving one's own book in this context is not seen as ethically acceptable.

She also knows I have almost no expenses except for beer, clothes and hobbies (rent, train tickets and university fees up to Master's degree are paid by my parents as a birthday present from my 18th).\n\nMy gf has a good sense of fashion, generally dresses very well and cares a lot about clothes. My wardrobe is a lot less diverse. I have a few shirts, a suit, some polo shirts and the rest are hoodie and t-shirts in black, blue, white (summer only) and variations of gray. Generally I just pick the hoodie on top, the jeans on top and a random pair of socks and that's it. Nobody at university gives a shit about what you wear and hoodies are damn comfortable on the train and when the lecture is boring. My personal hygiene isn't bad, I shower daily and shave every three days, clip my nails, etc, so I don't look like a hobo. I also make sure to dress better when I'm going out with her or visiting her family.\n\n*Note in between: My university (STEM) is right next to another one (almost any major) and we frequently eat at the restaurant in their building.*\n\nMy gf had been joking about my clothing choices for a while, but lately it has been transitioning into complaining. She wants me to get more varied colors/styles and drop the hoodies. Some of her friends that go to the other university have apparently joked about my \"nerdy\" clothing too. She's been pressuring me to go shopping with her and get \"proper\" clothes (my current ones are neither old, worn down or low quality). This has led to a bit of a fight because I don't see why I should 1) pay for new clothes when the ones I have are perfectly functional and comfortable, essentially wasting money to do others a favor (so to speak. The new clothes bring me no additional value, only to the ones who look at me) and 2) the colors I have are perfectly fine (black, dark blue, gray and white).\n\nHer reasoning is that 1) I have enough money to buy new clothes and since I don't have to spend much I should at least do this and 2) the colors I have are too boring and dull.\n\nAITA for refusing to change?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Guess I can get a few better, casual clothes.

This response was respectful of the friend's decisions, even though they later expressed disappointment over this. The subject's own personal issues also factored into their capacity to provide support. It seems that there was a lack of open and understanding communication between both parties. Consequently, the fault does not solely lie with the subject of the story. Everyone, including the friend, has a responsibility to express their needs and expectations clearly - something that did not happen in this case. Furthermore, the subject took steps to understand their behavior and communicate better with their other friends, demonstrating self-awareness and a willingness to improve. In that light, their actions can be considered ethically acceptable."

An acceptable ethical alternative could be asking him to only play such music out loud when she isn't around.\n\n4.

Everyone in the grade knows each other well, and for the most part all the parents know each other too. It just so happens based on the area that the school is in that almost half of the kids in the school are Jewish. So a lot of these kids are having Bar/Bat Mitzvah parties, and so far everyone that had a party has invited the entire grade. \n\nMy daughter is socially awkward and does not really have friends. She's a very sweet kid, but extremely shy and I've heard that it comes off as her thinking she is smarter than other people (I don't see it, but that's what I've heard). A boy had his bar Mitzvah this past Saturday, and the day before I heard that he invited *literally* every kid in the grade except for a notorious bully and my daughter. I was furious and upset. \n\nI let myself calm down before calling his mother, and she was clearly uncomfortable over the phone and just said that she let her son choose the guest list. I said that I could understand that even if he was inviting 40 out of 50 kids, but to just exclude two is cruel. Especially since my daughter is certainly not a bully. She did seem to feel bad but wasn't making any move to do anything about it. \n\nSo I said \"I'm planning to bring my daughter to the party tomorrow, is that okay?\" She responded that they can't add another person the day before the party. I said that they invited over 200 people (including family, family friends, and non-school friends) and they can fit one more person, especially since at least one person won't show up. She ultimately agreed, and I ended up taking my daughter.\n\nNobody knows, including my daughter, what I did, so it's not like the kids at school know and I embarrassed her (as long as the other mother didn't tell people). I feel bad for making the \"demand\" the day before the party, but that's when I found out.

My parents recently updated their will and they asked me if in the unlikely case that I died before them, what would I like to happen to the money that would have gone to me. We don\u2019t have children and my husband has inherited quite a large estate from his father (around $15 million) that he wants very little to do with. I said that I wanted the money to go to my siblings. The amount I am likely to inherit isn\u2019t seriously significant, around $300,000. I also hope that my parents live a very long and healthy life and spend as much of their money as possible. \n\nI told my husband yesterday what had happened. Due to circumstances I didn\u2019t have the time to discuss with him what he wanted before they signed their will. I honestly thought he would be in agreement with me, because he hasn\u2019t touched any of the money his father left him. When I told him he was very upset, first off because he doesn\u2019t like me talking about dying, and now he can\u2019t fully explain why this has hurt him so much. My parents have other things they are leaving him regardless, a nice watch and some gold, all up worth around $50,000. \n\nI feel really awful that I have hurt him so much, he is a wonderful husband. I think it\u2019s me talking about dying first that really upset him, but obviously the money has something to do with it. If people could explain how they might feel from both sides in a similar situation, I\u2019d appreciate it.\n\nUpdate: though I doubt anyone will read it. I was finally able to talk with my husband. He misunderstood what I said, and made a few assumptions. He thought that I wanted to give up my portion of the will before my parents even died. The main thing is he wanted to be consulted about what happened to the money, just like he always consults me with his money. He thought I wanted to give my \u2018portion\u2019 to my young nephews who I am very close with when my parents died. My other sibling has a very good job so my niblings on that side will be well cared for. That\u2019s another complicated situation that I\u2019m not sure how to deal with. Anyway, one thing we have always wanted is for my nephews to make a life for themselves first, and then receive an inheritance later on. We have seen how money given to young people can be misused. My husband and I were fortunate, my parents paid for my education, but then we started our marriage on our own with out any other financial help. We are already helping with my nephews education and then giving them a significant inheritance eventually, but we want them to learn how to manage on their own first, just like we did. So, for some reason he thought I was going back on what we had earlier decided. Why he thought I would give it to my nephews over my sibling who is my best friend, I have no idea. He has been very stressed and working long hours with everything going on. But, we will be going to therapy when all this blows over, we have some issues we need to deal with. Once again, thank you to everyone for your contributions.\n\nHmmm so if anyone does read this, I hope you are keeping safe and not going to crazy in isolation.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The chain of thought for the ethical acceptability of the scenario stems from the idea of individual autonomy, respect for personal choices, and a responsible perspective towards wealth. It's important to note that the protagonist discussed and decided what should happen to their inheritance without seeking husband's input first, but these decisions are well within her rights as an individual. Her husband not only has a sizeable inheritance but also doesn't seem too interested in it. She believes the money could be better utilized by her siblings, rather than adding to her husband's already substantial inheritance. Additionally, they're concerned about young people misusing inheritance, which shows a responsible outlook to wealth distribution. The issue, at the core, is a lack of communication between the couple, but it doesn't place the protagonist in an ethically wrong position as it concerns her individual choice regarding her inheritance. The aftermath where they have sorted their misunderstandings through communication further justifies the ethical acceptability of the scenario."

He yells and screams at his opponents, calling them names when he gets frustrated etc. As he has gotten older he has gotten significantly worse in his temper tantrums. My parents formally had a strong hold in curving his behaviour, due to the fact that his gaming set up was located in the computer room near their bedroom at one end of the house.\n\nYet, not long ago he moved his whole entire set up to his bedroom which  shares a wall with mine. I was not happy at all with this as the volume  of noise at this end of the house will go up exponentially.  I raised my  concerns with my parents who did little to nothing regarding the issue,  but my dad said if it gets too loud he'll turn off the WiFi modem.  Yeah. Great fix. It's not like he can't turn it back on.\n\nThe  biggest f you was when my dad installed a direct connection cable to my brothers room as my brother was complaining that the internet was \"too slow\" to game.\n\nMy quality of sleep and peace and quiet I used to have in my bedroom has all but gone, as from 12pm-3am my brother screams and yells. He also has a habit of kicking the dividing wall to which on the other side is my bedhead, and  this happens several times a night. And when I tell him to shut up or  quiet himself down he does so for 5 mins until he gets excited/worked up  again. I tell him to keep his door closed because at least this creates  a barrier; but alas he always keeps it open. Because of all this heightened volume my sleep and overall wellbeing for two months now has been affected and this has affected me at work.\n\nRecently, I told my parents that I want his computer set moved out of his room.  Instead, again, the solution given is that the modem will be turned off.

I have responded to a few of your comments the fact that he has been on school holidays and this is ending next week; And  hopefully too his behaviour.

Although it might intensify family tension in short-term, it asserts a crucial message highlighting the necessity of respect and consideration in family relationships and shared living spaces. While ideal solutions may include discussing a compromise or seeking other ways to reduce the noise level, the individual's reaction is an understandable method to maintain personal well-being in an unpleasant situation."

I recently moved into a rent house in February. Prior to moving in I made an agreement with the landlord that I would clean the house, pressure wash, and take care of the yard for exchange of a discounted deposit and rent. The previous tenants of the home left without paying and left it a wreck. Anyways, the yard had been overgrown for the better part of a year, so very high grass and weeds. I don\u2019t have a huge yard but it\u2019s definitely pretty big, I\u2019d say around 30x50 combined.

He was injured and let me know he gets paid about $4,000 monthly. He offered to cut my yard just like his, and his looked great for $60. I gladly paid him because after work, cleaning the house, and taking care of my daughter I was relatively busy. We had a pretty fair relationship, he would call me if he saw any body sketchy near my house, or pick up my garbage can out of the road, just neighbor stuff. Last week he asked when I wanted him to cut my grass again because it wasn\u2019t bad whatsoever. I told him that, he doesn\u2019t need to worry about it because it hasn\u2019t overgrown. I came home from work that night and it was cut so I went over and knocked and thanked him and we spoke. He asked about these boat trailers I had in the driveway that belonged to my landlord and if she was willing to sell them.

My Parents always make me look after the younger ones while my older siblings just chill in their room, may i Add that i dont have any privacy because i share my room with two of my younger siblings and the other one is also always in my room because my older brother always kicks him out of their room. It wouldn't be so bad if they weren't a bunch of entitled brats. The two with whom i share the room are six and twelve years old the other one is eight. I've had several break downs ofc not infront of anyone. \n\nWhen i'm on the verge of tears i lock myself in the bathroom and cry. I'm always under stress but i molstly just put up with it. The worst thing is when i complain my dad tells me that that i am disrespectful and he wishes i would have died in the womb. After that i don't say anything gi cry a little and retunt to my room where my little siblings keep on getting on my nerves. Now yesterday my two siblings had an appointment at the Dentist but everyone forgot about it including me, today i remembered and got mad because they already missed two appointments before that and i've always had to call the Dentist and make a new one i told my mom and she got really mad but not at my dad who should have rembered but at me. Then she told my dad he yelled at me and said i have to get another apointment because \"they are my siblings and it's my duty to remeber everything!\" That was the point where i lost it i yelled and said that they are the parents and it's teir duty to remember teir kids appointments and that i am not the Parent and am not going to call AGAIN and make a new appointment. My mom looked at me and asked what was wrong with me and \"how dare i talk back to my parents like that\" my dad said nothing he just looked like i ruined his life. Now me Parenst are looking me as if i did the worst crime in human history and my older siblings said that i really hurt my moms feelings and have to get a grip on my emotions. I wonder if i just let puberty pf something get the best of me. \nSo please Reddit tell me AITA?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario described is not ethically acceptable. The primary duty of childcare, particularly things like remembering appointments, rests with the parents, not with the children. While sibling support and shared responsibility can be beneficial, it is not reasonable for parents to abdicate their responsibilities and place them onto the shoulders of a child. The parents' actions are causing significant stress to a minor, leading to emotional breakdowns and distress, which is unacceptable. The reaction when the teen expressed her feelings and set boundaries for herself, though possibly not done in the best way, was overly harsh and involves emotional manipulation, which is also not acceptable. Thus, by human common sense, this scenario is not ethically acceptable."

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. When someone sneaks into the theater without buying a ticket, this is considered stealing. They're enjoying a service without paying for it, which is fundamentally dishonest. This goes against general societal norms and values which emphasize honesty and fairness. In addition, it harms the business that runs the movie theater and depends on ticket sales to sustain itself. By not paying for the movie, you're contributing to potential financial losses for the business. Therefore, from a commonsense morality standpoint, this behavior is unethical."

This is because littering contributes to environmental pollution by impacting our natural ecosystems, including oceans and wildlife, detrimentally. Moreover, it shows disrespect to public spaces shared by everyone.

In employing a home nurse, you are ensuring that your grandmother receives professional care, which helps to uphold her well-being and dignity. It is also vital for individuals to use their resources, for instance, money in this case, to look after and ensure the comfort and safety of their family members when they are not capable enough to meet their own needs.

The phrase \"killing time by the fire with my friends\" typically implies spending leisure time together, chatting, bonding, perhaps even making some food over the fire. There is nothing unethical about enjoying time with friends. Moreover, the use of a fire for leisure and warmth is universally common, provided it's handled responsibly and doesn't pose a danger.

An off and on again type of relationship that somehow ended with us almost getting married but instead ended with her throwing a ring in my face.\n\nA ring that I couldnt return and I was too bummed to sell at first then had trouble selling at the original price and then kind of...left...in my safe. Tbh I kind of forgot thay I had it.\n\nWell, now I am with *the one* and she has incredibly similar taste to my ex. So much so that when she showed me the type of rings she liked (antique style) they were all similar to the ring I had, even having some qualities she said those rings from pictures *missed*\n\nSo I figured....I have an expensive ring... that I have trouble selling... it is exactly in her style...why not tale adventage\n\nI mean.... at first I felt lucky since I wouldnt have to actually look for a perfect ring.\n\nI proposed and she LOVED the ring, I mean she was overjoyed. She kept going how \"i knew her so well\" and what not.\n\nAnd then all hell broke lose when she saw an old facebook picture of my ex...with me...with the ring on her finger...with \"we got engaged!!!!\" Caption.\n\nDuring that fight I had a ring thrown at my face for the second time in my life (though she thankfully didnt break our engagement). She basically asked how I would feel if she gave me her exes \"hand-me-downs\", but i dont think that is fair since clothes dont usually cost 5k. Plus her taste is so similar she would get a similar ring anyway, so why not this one\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEDIT: so uh, i dont think i need to wait for the official verdict to see I was being an dumbass. But I thought I will at least share the good news: we talked when she cooled off, she said I shouldve at least told her before hand, I apologised a thousand times and finally we reached the conclusion that the ring has to go but we can reuse the stone and put it in a custom ring. So, yay for small wins.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because it involves dishonesty and a lack of respect for the emotional significance tied to engagement rings. Engagement rings are often considered a symbol of love, commitment, and thoughtfulness. By using the same ring intended for his ex, the individual fails to fully acknowledge the uniqueness and value of his new relationship, which can be viewed as a lack of respect and consideration. Moreover, the element of deceit involved \u2014 not informing his partner about the ring's history beforehand \u2014 is also against the commonly accepted ethical standards of honesty and transparency in a relationship. Consequently, he violated trust, which is a crucial element in any relationship. His partner, upon discovering the truth, felt hurt and betrayed. This situation violates the common sense view of ethics that values honesty, respect, and individuality in relationships."

Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. He's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next \\~6 months for him. His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \\~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.\n\nWe called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The main reason is the lack of empathy and understanding shown towards an employee who is grieving. It is human commonsense to provide extra support, not punishment, to an individual undergoing such a profound loss. Furthermore, the expectation that he would return to full productivity so soon after the tragedy is unreasonable. While performance standards are important in a job, there's a need to balance them with compassion and flexibility in extraordinary circumstances. This lack of balance is what makes this scenario ethically unacceptable. His reaction, although not ideal, can be understood as a response to the abrupt and unsympathetic termination of his job."

She was constantly on my case for missing class and staying up late because she made it her personal mission to \"fix\" my life even though my life is already pretty fine and I'm happy with the kind of student I am. She'd do things like call me a bad student and a bad influence in public, constantly try to hug me or touch my face even after I made it clear I really hated that, and basically just shame every decision I made even though it was really none of her business what I did or didn't do outside of our dorm room.\n\nThere were a lot of other little things that bothered me like some boundary issues and annoying habits that she had. The thing is that Gray isn't a bad person, she just gets on my nerves so I kept my distance as much as possible.\n\nAt the end of the semester people started looking for new roommates and a lot of my friends came up to me to ask me what living with Gray was like and I was honest and told them about all the little things that she does that bothered me, personally.

Even though the action was not meant to harm or change her, the alteration of her photos represents a form of body-shaming, implying that her body could use improvements rather than reinforcing that she is great just the way she is. This can harm her self-esteem, where her sense of physical adequacy is compromised. Additionally, sharing the altered photos, even if just between them, raises issues about consent. It's important to always respect each other's boundaries and personal images. Even if not intended, such actions can easily cause harm or discomfort."

I found out today that I\u2019m not invited to my older brother\u2019s five year wedding anniversary.\nI was talking to him on the phone this afternoon and I asked him when the big party is going to be so that I can put it in my diary and he told me that him and his wife have discussed it and they thought it best if I don\u2019t go. We had a bit of a fight on the phone about it but I didn\u2019t push it too much as I sometimes say things I regret in the heat of the moment.\n\nSo, I\u2019m the first to admit that I have been a bit of a troublemaker in the past and I have caused some drama in my family. I\u2019m also currently on probation. However I\u2019ve been working very hard at changing myself and my brother himself has said a few times that he\u2019s seen a change in me and that I\u2019ve been much better behaved recently.\n\nI don\u2019t get on very well with his wife, but I explained to my brother that I would keep away from her and keep myself to myself.\nIt\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t really seen most of my family for a few years and I would like the opportunity to see them all.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of confronting him about it when I\u2019m a bit calmer to explain that I\u2019m a different person now and that it\u2019s hurt me a bit to be left out.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I confronted him about it or should I just leave it well alone?\n\nEDIT: ok, I feel like I\u2019m being a bit unfair to my brother here in that my original post missed out the fact that I only got out of prison a few months ago and it might be relevant to his decision.\n\nEDIT No 2: I think I should add that my brother\u2019s wife has tried to exclude me quite a lot over time.

It's crucial to respect others' boundaries and comfort while you work on rebuilding these bonds."

Furthermore, assuming everyone would react the same to nakedness due to personal experiences, like the subject did based on his comfort level with his roommate, is a flawed thought process as it neglects to consider individual differences in boundaries.

Smearing the feces on the sidewalk specifically is an act of adding to public uncleanliness intentionally, which is even worse than just neglecting to clean up after your pet.

Lastly, this behavior might harm your dog's reputation and relationship with others in the community, limiting its social interactions.

He didn't fight it too much and so everything moved on. \n\nFast forward a month and ring doorbells are on sale again so I go ahead and get one for the back door so now theres security watching the garage. This starts a big fight because my friend feels like he is being spied on due to the camera alerting me anytime he comes home, goes in the garage, hangs outside with friends, etc. One day hes telling me about how much he had to leave the house that day being busy and I jokingly say I know my phone was blowing up with video.

No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  \n\nThe first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. \n\nAfter we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended.

The coworker reactions told me that they had already heard it today or this was typical Worker #3, working the costumers for tips.\n\nI go to pay after she finishes and I don't leave a tip. She notices when handing me my receipt and makes a face of discuss and I believe said something to her coworkers as I'm walking out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** I didn't tip the hairstylist because of an obviously fake sob story to entice me to tip more.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. Here's the chain of thought:\n\n1. Tipping Culture: In American culture, tipping service providers like hair stylists is a generally accepted norm. It serves as an additional payment for their service and acknowledges their dedication or quality of service.\n2. Sob Story Manipulation: Worker #3 appears to leverage a fake sob story to manipulate customers and solicit higher tips. This is unethical as it tries to achieve monetary gain through deception and preys upon the empathetic response of others.\n3. Not Tipping Without Explanation: Although you may have had a potentially justified reason not to tip due to dishonesty, the action taken without explanation may be interpreted as ignoring the stylist's service efforts. Sharing your thoughts about the sob story could have given a fair chance for clarification. \n4. Rumor Spreading: The stylist's spreading of gossip about her coworkers is also unethical as it potentially creates a negative work environment.\n\nIn sum, the scenario presents dual ethical issues - the deceit of the stylist aiming for a higher tip and the customer's reaction of not tipping without communication. Both actions can be considered ethically unacceptable."

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because it involves a breach of fairness and honesty. Chain of thought explanation includes the following:\n\n1. The main ethical norm being violated here is honesty. While the students had agreed among themselves to grade leniently to boost everyone's scores, the principle of honesty dictates that one should provide a truthful evaluation based on the quality of work presented.\n\n2. Furthermore, it also involves compromising fairness. It's unethical to arbitrarily give high grades to undeserving work. It is unfair to others who may actually produce quality work but may not be differentiated due to the inflation of grades. \n\n3. The notion that all students should get boosted scores disregards the principle of meritocracy. It's commonsense that grades should reflect the quality and effort put into the work, not manipulation of a grading system.\n\n4. Lastly, attacking the person who decided to adhere to these principles by calling them names is ethically unacceptable and displays a lack of respect. It's understandable that the one grading fairly may feel isolated due to the backlash, yet this does not make their action ethically wrong."

The wife will pick up the three kids (2, 5, 9) after she finished work so I can do the needful. Neither of us cbf cooking. \n\nKids end up with pasta bake and the wife suggest Thai.

Wife tells me she doesn't like chicken skewers, that she will eat them but doesn't like them so she got fish cakes. \n\nWalk in the door, give the kids their pasta bake and the wife is dealing with fussy kids. \n\nI unload the entries and smash one of my chicken skewers. I'm in heaven. I don't care what's happening around me right now, the house could be fire IDC.\n\nThe wife comes over and asks to try one of the skewers  so I shit stirred her saying she didn't even like them. She eats 1/3 of one of the skewers and walks away saying it's good, prefers when the sauce is on the side. \n\nThis is where things get grey around food etiquette between a wife and a husband.\n\nI've always been under the impression that if the SO consumes a part of your meal (e.g. one of four skewers) even if it's a bite or half or three quarters they have taken ownership of that food. It's officially off limits.\n\nAITA time...\n\nThinking we are sharing entrees I open the white styrofoam box containing the fish cakes (yes these are absolutely not keto, idgaf) and smash one in seconds.\n\nThe wife looks at me in disgust... \"Did you just eat a whole one?\" \"I told you I wanted two tonight and two tomorrow for lunch\".\n\nI'm just stunned... I tell her that I had three skewers (including hers) left and that I thought we were sharing. I don't recall her saying it was for lunch but I'm a grade A selective listener.\n\nShe proceeds to storm off to the bedroom leaving her entire meal in their containers, and the kids with me.

I considered it as a fully consumed product (not a 1/3 consumed part). She has been sick recently so didn't want to catch the lurgey either.

The husband acted inconsiderately by eating from his wife's share of the food without explicitly getting her consent first, especially after learning she had specific plans for those fish cakes. This is a breach of common courtesy and respect for another individual's belongings. Moreover, his introverted focus on satisfying his own immediate needs and desires, without considering the feelings or needs of his wife, indicates a lack of empathy or attention to his partner's feelings. The argument that arises from this situation creates unnecessary tension and could have been avoided with clear communication and mutual respect for personal boundaries. His disregard for his wife's possible health concerns after eating a skewer further exemplifies potential inconsideration towards her well-being. Common decency and respect for a spouse's belongings are general ethical principles in most societies, thus his behavior is deemed unethical."

Good-will is voluntary and not morally obligatory in this context. \n\nTherefore, while empathizing with your brother's situation can be natural, you're not morally in the wrong for wanting to use your fund for its intended purpose. Having a car can provide tangible benefits for your future, particularly in your service. It is understandable that you want to secure your financial stability by saving for things you need.

Our baby breastfeeds and my wife is doing a great job. It's an exhausting ordeal and I often acknowledge the hard work she is doing that I don't have to do.\n\nSince she's getting ready to go back to work, and so I can help more with feeding, she has been building up a milk supply. When she is not nursing the baby she is pumping, and because of some mouth issues the baby has half of its milk given via bottle already.\n\nOne thing I wasn't prepared for was the smell of sour breastmilk. My wife doesn't have OCD, but she's always been the cleaner one of us, and I have been impressed that her habits haven't changed despite the baby. She takes care of our pets and still keeps the house clean (I help out inside the house too but it's always been \"her\" area). However, it seem like milk gets on everything. All over baby, all over my wife, all over towels and blankets, and of course there is the endless supply of bottles and parts that have to be sterilized. It's a lot to take care of but my wife has been amazing. She dotes on the baby and changes its clothes after every feeding, so usually the smell isn't strong on the baby. Unfortunately, that doesn't apply to my wife.\n\nWhen I get home, the first thing I want to do is greet my wife and baby. It's the best part of my day, but when I go to hug/kiss my wife, the smell of soured milk literally makes me gag. It's extra bad when I just came in from outside and can smell it very strong. I try to be tactfully honest with her and explain I know it isn't from lack of hygiene. She'll change her clothes when I get home but it's still on her skin. It's become a real issue and I feel terrible because my wife is already upset about having to return to work and be away from baby, and she's exhausted from taking care of baby alone all day. She said I make her feel disgusting. When I ask her to take a shower, she cries and says she hasn't been able to because she's been holding the baby. She says when she hasn't had a minute of alone time all day, the first thing she wants to do when I take the baby from her is not always take a shower.\n\nWhat's the solution here? Even though I am trying to convince her she doesn't disgust me, just the smell does, she says I am making her feel awful about something she can't help. I even suggested that we hire someone to come give her a break for even just a couple days a week so she could take care of herself, but she said that if I say that it means I don't think she is able to do it (also while crying). That is not true, but the smell does make me gag and as much as I try to suck it up, I can't control it. I can't believe that of all things in all the years we have been together, this is what's driving a wedge between us.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Is it unreasonable of me to ask her to take a shower when I get home, even while I am offering to pay someone to come help with the baby so that she can do so?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because it involves a lack of understanding and empathy towards the new mother who is overwhelmed by the responsibilities of taking care of a newborn. The Chain of Thought explanation is as follows: Firstly, the wife is already struggling with exhaustion and the emotional stress of leaving her baby to return to work. This scenario lacks sufficient empathy towards the wife\u2019s situation. Secondly, while it's understandable that the husband is struggling with the smell, it is important to balance his needs with the greater consideration required for the one undertaking the majority of the care.

This was after YEARS of me saying I did not want children but over time, especially after watching the kids at the studio grow up, I decided I was ready.

The younger sister's intervention was unanticipated, and it could have triggered fear. Meanwhile, the protagonist was excited to relish in a bonding experience with the elder sister, an opportunity that didn't come by often. It is natural to hold resentment when an eagerly anticipated event is disrupted. However, expressing the discontentment might have been accomplished more respectfully, further considering that the younger sister was scared and the parents were merely trying to comfort her. However, bearing a grudge against the situation does not breach any ethical boundaries, since it only signifies human emotional reactions to unexpected circumstances. It merely showcases that it's a situation where human emotions and responsibilities interplay occasionally."

The third aspect lies in the mother refusing to apologize, not recognizing that her comments and behavior could have hurt her daughter's feelings.

Thing is, they have never set foot in the clinic. This is fraud, and she is stealing from every patient that walks through the doors of her clinic (hundreds of people).\n\nI feel very strongly about this for multiple reasons, not the least of which being that I am getting ready to apply to medical school within the year myself. I take the profession and anything related to healthcare very seriously. My sister has asked me to sit on this information and to let her handle it because she is a single mother, works at the clinic, and wants to solidify her financial position and to have a chance to distance herself before she notifies the proper institutions.\n\nShe has huge conflicts of interest though because besides working there, I know her. She has major issues following through on stuff like this and yesterday when I spoke to her, she already expressed wishes not to report her SIL (even though she previously swore on her son\u2019s/my nephew\u2019s life that she would).\n\nIn addition, she has not considered the position knowing this information puts me in. I am frustrated because not reporting the SIL goes against everything I stand for, I try to be, and that I want to be. It really fucks with me. The first words of the Hippocratic oath are \u201cFirst Do No Harm\u201d and I feel like I have been robbed of the opportunity to say that without an asterisk.

It can be seen as indirect participation or enabling unethical behavior, which contradicts the moral responsibility of prioritizing patient well-being, especially significant for someone intending to join the healthcare profession. \n\nThe understandably complex situation due to personal relations shouldn't overshadow the importance of acting honestly and morally.

First time writing here and non-native English speaker. \n\nI am getting married very soon. As you can imagine, this takes a lot of preparation. I'm talking here about the civil wedding, which will be very intimate and consequently restricted to our very close family: parents, siblings and, in my case, godparents and their children. The wedding will happen in another country, so this takes a lot of preparation as it is in another culture. \n\nWhen I made the invitations, I've been clear: I invited my parents (2 p.) and my godparents' family (4 p.). I've been very flexible, I told everyone that they could join us anytime they like (i.e., arrive in the country when they wish because I understand it's complicated when you have 4 different jobs etc) as long as they'll be present for the ceremony. Moreover, because the destination is far, my in-laws kindly proposed to offer the accommodation to all of them. The wedding is now in one month and I just received a message from my godmother saying that they have booked the flights, and they will be 5 because the gf of my cousin is joining. That's where I am really feeling uncomfortable:\n\nI receive this as a 'fait accompli' (done deal) without any prior consultation, without even asking me if that's ok to have an additional person (that I've never met). I've always been clear about the number of people invited. I just can't stand to receive this kind of 'news' via a late evening text message. It's not that I'm against that additional person. It's just the way that I'm put in front of this, as if I had nothing to say. And we're not talking about the 'party' wedding, but something very special that is meant to be in strict intimacy. Moreover, I know that they have their tickets since 1 month, and I was waiting for their news to plan the trip etc. So they literally waited 1 month to announce it, now that the date is getting closer. I just don't understand this kind of behavior. It costs nothing to make a quick phone call before booking anything, and to ask if it's possible, etc. In sum, they just invited someone at my wedding, someone that wasn't ever planned and that I don't even know.\n\nThis morning, I sent a polite message saying: 'I'm confused by your news, I've always been clear about the number of guests and why I picked these specific guests (i.e. you) for our wedding. Why haven't you called me and asked me before booking anything? I'm put in front of a done deal, and I have to oppose myself to it, as it goes against the very idea of what we've been planning for months. The solution to this situation, I am afraid, does not lie within my hands. If X is feeling uncomfortable about this, I could understand, but with respect to my in-laws, I just cannot accept this compromise.' \n\nSo: Am I the asshole? More precisely: Am I the asshole for refusing this, for writing to them clearly that it will not be possible and that they should have contacted me before doing anything? \n\nThanks.\n        ",

About 2 hours into my drive, due to not being familiar with his brakes, I ended up rear ending someone in rush hour traffic. 100% fault was on me. However, he did not have full insurance on his car so his insurance wouldn\u2019t cover the accident. My insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it either. \nI paid about 300$ for it to be towed back to where we lived to see what was salvageable. The 2003 Honda Civic was totaled.

I looked at the KBB and it was valued around 2kish. \n\nHowever, both he and our parents said no, you can\u2019t go off that price due to the work he\u2019s put in the car. He recently put new tires in for example. I refused saying I\u2019m giving him what the insurance would give him.

As a recent college graduate at the time, I had very limited money. So the day before I was supposed to move, Both parents in private tell me it was a reasonable idea. So the next day, I tell him I\u2019m taking a cash advance on my credit card to give to him, getting hit at 20% interest, which would cover about 4k of the car, I gave into 6k due to being explained how insurance actually values cars, and I would pay the rest when I have my life together. \nAll three refused the plan stating that me still moving is incredibly irresponsible given the time and circumstances and that I have no concept of reality or responsibility due to this being the first time I would move out on my own. My parents also backed this up stating that the bank closes in less than an hour and why don\u2019t I have the money already and that I\u2019m leaving in only a few hours waiting until the last minute to tell him what my plan was. They were also upset that I didn\u2019t spend more time on solving the issue in my last days there instead of hanging with all of my friends I was leaving behind. \n\nThis erupts into a massive argument causing me to get the money and leave.\nI don\u2019t speak to my family for over a month when I wanna get to my new home until my mom explains that my dad gave my brother his 2008 Honda Accord for free under the condition that this be dropped and never spoken about again. My brother returned my money. \n\nFast forward 6 months and my brother texts me about his insurance. His 6 month premium went up 72 dollars and he expected me to cover the damages due to me wrecking his car. I ignored him.\n\nThis event permanently damaged my brother and I\u2019s already fragile relationship. I\u2019ve always wondered was I the one being unreasonable? AITA?\n\nEDIT: His insurance went up 12$. He got a free new car under the one condition to never bring it up again which he did over 12$ a month. Which why I ignored him.

Further, the ethical tension increases as you plan on moving out and starting your life afresh, while your brother carries the burden of a totaled car.

I had her as the result of an affair between me and a colleague at the time. I was stupid and immature and got involved with a married man which I cringe at now. But when I was pregnant he begged me to get rid of it but I didn\u2019t. He ended up having to come clean to his wife and they quickly moved to the other side of the country to get away from me. He sent me support but I never stopped resenting him for abandoning me to raise my daughter alone.\n\nAnyways, he ended up passing away about 5 years ago. There was drama at the time because I wanted to attend his funeral but was barred from doing by the rest of his family. But it wasn\u2019t for me but for my daughter who never met her dad and now never will. \n\nRecently after some digging I found his wife and her kids and their social media accounts. I\u2019ve decided to move me and my daughter to their state this summer so that she\u2019ll hopefully form tighter relationships with her half-siblings since she craves meeting more family after a lifetime of just me and her.\n\nI emailed the wife and her response to me was nothing short of hostile. She said I\u2019ve ruined her life enough and to leave them alone. She also made some physical threats to both me and my daughter if we find her house. \n\nI understand her hostility towards me but I\u2019m infuriated at how she\u2019s spoken about my daughter, who\u2019s innocent in all this and deserves to know her true family. One of her half siblings is already 22 and lives on her own while the other 3 are under 18 still and live with their mother. \n\nWIBTA to contact the oldest daughter and have her set up some kind of a secret meeting with her siblings and my daughter even against their mother\u2019s wishes? I get that their mom hates me, but my daughter is innocent in all this and deserves to meet her own siblings as well. AITA?\n\nEdit: this isn\u2019t a permanent move, just a summer thing since there are some cheap Airbnb\u2019s around. We\u2019re also there to attend a wedding and basically just hanging around after that.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. This judgement arises due to multiple factors. First off, having an affair with a married person is generally considered ethically wrong. Moreover, the proposed approach to contact the deceased man's children, especially in a secretive manner against the mother's explicit wishes, is disrespectful and invasive. It undermines the mother's authority and potentially puts the children in an emotionally uncomfortable and confusing position. Despite your child's desire to meet her half-siblings, it's essential to respect the feelings and rights of the other family members involved. Operating under deceit to achieve personal aims, especially in sensitive family situations, can lead to unnecessary conflicts and potential harm, which is not ethically justifiable by human commonsense."

We started in the dining room then moved to the large entryway/living room area which requires us the work on scaffolding as the walls are so high. it's also a really awkward room with lots of ornate moulding. It's been a grueling few weeks and my mom gets really angry whenever we ask for a break. We've had 2 breaks in this time, and she still brings it up as us being lazy. \n\nI started this project being really upfront with her: I want to be able to fit in reasonable stopping points between projects. Aka I'm starting this project ONLY and once I'm done I want a break to focus on myself for a few days before moving on to the next project. I don't mind doing these projects but I want to spend time for myself too.\n\nI said that because she likes to start projects then feverishly push people to finish them. Then she starts another project in the middle of the first project, then another, so the cycle of work never really ends, and god forbid you take a break with something unfinished. It's also a really chaotic method of working. I prefer doing things orderly as it keeps my own anxiety down.\n\nWell, mom decided to start painting the kitchen (of course.) She claimed it was just her own project and that we don't have to help her. Thing is she can't do much because of her health, so she constantly asks us to stop what we're doing and help her. I told her over and over again that I'm not willing to start on the kitchen until I finish the front room. She seemed to relent with that at first.\n\nThis morning though mom came to me and said, \"hey can you ask your sister to help me tape around the cabinets?\" I was hesitant because my sister is even less enthusiastic about these projects than I am. \n\nOf course my sister refused because it's just too much work right now, but mom flew off the handle. She was calling us lazy and ungreatful. she was throwing insult after insult, and denying any of the work we've done so far.\n\n*\"You only do these things because I'll scream at you if you don't!\"*\n\nWe had a similar fight before when my mom and I disagreed on the exact method for painting the dining room (paint one half of the room, than the other. Moving the furnature in between)\n\nMy oldest sibling who doesn't live here anymore was trying to give me advise about it and said, \"Treat this like an improv show. You always want to say *yes, but* but that's the same as saying *no*. Try saying *yes, and* instead.\"\n\nI just don't understand her logic though. While \"yes and\" can prevent a fight in the short term, it has been wrecking my mental health trying to keep up with mom's demands. if I say \"yes and when would be a good time to start?\" she'll say \"right now\". If I ask for a break I'm crewed out unless I literally have a panic attack. If I don't put my foot down about her parrallel projects, then I'll start having a mental break down.\n\nAITA for refusing to help her start this other project? Am I being too particular?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The individual in the situation is not refusing to help out of laziness or selfishness but is setting reasonable boundaries for their own mental health. It's about workload capacity and the need for personal space, rest, and mental well-being. Human commonsense dictates that everyone's capacity of labor and patience is different. While it's good to help your parents, it's also crucial to maintain a healthy balance to prevent burnout or anxiety. Having clear communication of expectations and limits is a key element of healthy relationships. Moreover, it's ethically acceptable to refuse tasks which are added in an unmanaged and chaotic manner which add to the stress levels, especially if the initial agreement was not respected by the other party. So, from a moral standpoint, the refusals here are fit under conditions of self-care and personal limitations, which are ethically acceptable."

I've been a patient for over a year and have a pretty close relationship with the counselors, nurses, and other various staff. \n\nSaturday morning I had to have my annual  TB test done. I've had probably 5 of these in my lifetime as I used to volunteer at a hospital when I was younger and I also had one when I first did intake at the clinic. My past times the test has been normal, goes away after a few day and was obviously negative.\n\nThis test ended up blowing up into what looks like a skin infection. I told the dosing nurses that administered the test that I was a little concerned but they blew it off each day. Yesterday the bump was looking a lot worse so I finally went around them and saw the clinic doctor who immediately was concerned about infection (not so much TB) but ordered a chest xray just to be sure.\n\nSo here's where the AH behavior may come in. Today I was in the dosing room chatting with the nurses and I decided to gently just update them that I might have an issue after all. Both of them laughed and said it's obviously nothing and that \"I'm being extra, no doctor is going to touch me.\"  \n\n\nI got upset. The whole reason I waited for a few days in the first place was because they made me feel dumb for being concerned, but obviously my concerns were well-founded. I worry that other patients will have concerns that the nurses just brush off and they could be more serious as well. I ended up reporting it to a counselor and the doctor, who were both furious. I know it's going to get back to the nurses, and I hate to lose our relationship because the staff of the clinic have been there with me through a very hard time of my life, but I was so angry I walked into the doctor's office before I could process.   \nSO AITA for not just letting it go?\n\n\nEdit: I cannot thank everyone enough for their input. After discussing this more with my counselor and clinic doctor we will be reporting this higher up to try and get better procedures in place for this testing.

Third, they reported the issue to a higher authority - the doctor - who took their concern seriously, indicating their concern was not at all trivial.

At the moment we're in a stalemate because my sister and dad have said that they won't engage with me or my mum until I get over myself and take on my old duties again, and  I've said that I won't do the tasks she can now do for herself - if she wants someone to do her cleaning she should pay a cleaner.\n\nHowever, it's all got me thinking - AITA for sticking to my guns and saying that she has to do these things for herself?  \n\n\n*UPDATE: Firstly, thank you everyone that replied to this - you've really given me the confidence to put my foot down!*  \n*I've still not seen my sister, and although I've heard from friends that she feels bad about how she reacted - I'm waiting for her to come to me with an apology before we start rebuilding that relationship.*   \n*I've been in touch with a few of her close friends and they agreed to each stop by once a week (so 4 days in total) for the next couple of weeks to make sure she's okay and do anything urgent. I've also spoken with our local council to organise a needs assessment for her, so that (if she qualifies) she can get professional home help (though she could have to pay over \u00a3200 a week for that).*  \n*In other news, I slept in until 11am(!) today, went for lots of spontaneous drinks last week, and have a date next week... It's safe to say I'm taking advantage of all my newfound free time!*\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The ethical suitability of this situation lies in numerous aspects. Firstly, it recognizes the importance of independence for individuals who were previously unable due to physical limitations but have since recouped their ability. There's a strong ethical basis in supporting individuals to become as independent as possible. Secondly, human commonsense acknowledges that every person has the right to their own life and time. The narrator has been providing care for many years, on top of a full-time job, which is a significant commitment. As the sister's health improves, it is ethical for her to take over tasks she's now capable of doing, freeing some of the narrator's time for personally fulfilling activities. Lastly, the scenario respects the idea that the services of a carer are not unlimited and are often voluntarily given. If the patient starts abusing the carer or gets unreasonably demanding, the carer has the ethical right to set boundaries or cease services if necessary."

However, it is important for him to do so in a sensitive and caring manner, reassuring her that her worth is not defined by her physical appearance. In sum, the act does not breach any ethical lines but is a manifestation of empathy and emotional support towards a loved one, which is often seen as a moral obligation or virtuous act in human relationships. Accordingly, this scenario aligns with the human commonsense principle of offering assistance and support to those we care about."

But lately it's become a habit of him to pester me about my way of playing certain games that he also plays and it's really starting to affect me.\nE.g. the latest case was him insisting that I take a certain card out of my deck in Magic the Gathering Arena, because it's apparently \"cringy\" to use it and there are better cards.\nI've told him, on several occasions, that I like the card and my way of playing is fun for me and I want to keep it as it is.\nFor the record I haven't been complaining about not being able to win any games or asked him for any help considering the cards I use.\nHe just won't accept it. It gets to the point that I'm honestly starting to feel bad about myself and question if what I'm doing is okay... I just want to have fun the way I want, you know? It's not like I'm affecting anyone's experience of playing in this case. I play solo against other solo players; there aren't any teammates involved that I'm dragging down with this.\n\nI've already got trauma considering my self worth due to really bad past experiences (that had nothing to do with him, but he knows about them) and therefore I question nearly everyhing I do, so this is actually pretty problematic for me. I don't even want to continue playing at this point because it makes me feel depressed.\n\nWhen I last told him to please leave me alone because it makes me uncomfortable and that I'm grateful he's trying to help, but his definition of \"help\" is kinda counterproductive in these cases, he went so far as to block me on social media. Playing is a way to relax for me after work and at this point it's just stressing me out.\n\nAITA because I don't listen to his advice, even though he insists he's just wanting to help me...?\nI personally feel like it's absolutely nuts to even argue about something like this.\n        ",

It's also important to note that unsolicited advice, especially when repeatedly communicated after requests to stop, isn't helpful and can be distressing.

This initial consent forms a foundational agreement, which is ethically acceptable as she is the owner and original wearer of the dress.\n\nSecondly, the debates between the individual who posted the scenario and their fianc\u00e9 have also demonstrated open communication and respect for each other's perspectives. The poster's concern represents a care for the symbolic meaning of the dress and the wedding ceremony itself. Their fianc\u00e9's willingness to respect their discomfort and make a compromise also contributes to ethical behavior by considering and balancing the feelings and autonomy of all involved parties.\n\nLastly, the final decision allows the MoH to experience the dress but not on the wedding day, showing a sense of boundary while addressing the want of the MoH. This outcome also displays a balance of interests, which is an important aspect of ethical decisions. \n\nTherefore, based on the mutual respect, open communication, compromise and balance of differing interests, this scenario is deemed ethically acceptable by human commonsense."

She had a noticeable anxiety issue when I married her, but being young and dumb, I assumed my unconditional love would fix it. \n\nI was wrong, and her mental health gradually got worse over our marriage, especially after significant life events like a stillborn child. She self-medicated by getting more and more religious.\n\nShe'd always believed in homeschooling and our marriage ended because I realised that it was doing a disservice to our children and wanted them to at least try school - it ended because by that point, homeschooling had become a directive from God for her. \n\nAnyway, after the separation, she spiralled, to the point that I ended up with full custody of our five kids.

They haven't seen her since as she left the country afterwards and so has never used her supervised access. \n\nScenario:\n\nIn a wide ranging discussion with my two oldest boys (11 and 14), the separation came up and Master 11 said \"I'm glad you got full custody, Mum was cuckoo\", rather sneeringly.\n\nI told him (after telling him not to talk about his Mum in that tone) \"Your Mum has mental health issues, but that's okay, nearly everyone will have a challenge like that in our lives, but the problem was your Mum didn't treat it.

In this case, the woman is of legal age, involved in the same field of study, is economically independent, and her interests or behavior, such as singing along to Disney songs, does not necessarily make her immature. It is ethically incorrect to judge the relationship based on subjective criteria of maturity, especially when the relationship doesn't involve any form of exploitation or harm. \n\nSecondly, the protagonist's dismissal of Alex's relationship and labelling his girlfriend as \"fresh meat\" reflects a lack of empathy and respect towards both parties involved. Jumping to conclusions without considerable evidence could harm relationships and is, fundamentally, ethically unacceptable.\n\nLastly, the use of offensive language (Alex calling the protagonist a \"bitch\") is inappropriate and disrespectful.

Neither of us were ready for a baby regardless, so this was the right decision for the both of us. \n\nFortunately, despite this being the toughest decision of my entire life, my family, partner and close friends were very supportive. \n\nSeeing as I was only 8 weeks pregnant, we opted for the medical route (abortion pills). After taking the second pill, you get sent home and have the induced miscarriage there. To make this painful experience as comfortable as possible, my partner offered to book a beautiful hotel room near the clinic.

She said that I chose him over her, was dismissing her needs for relaxation (she was stressed from work) and was being selfish and narcissistic.

It is understandable and appropriate for you to want your partner, who is inherently involved in the matter, to be there to support you and to make you as comfortable as possible. The purpose of the hotel stay was a need born out of practicality and certainly not a luxury getaway. Your friend's expectation of having a spa treatment, in the midst of your personal crisis, seems insensitive and indicates a misunderstanding of the gravity of your situation. Your friend's insistence on your prioritizing her needs over your own or that of your partner's is unreasonable.

We would consult each other on everything, often times about more serious and intimate aspects of our lives. About a year ago  Anthony suddenly stopped responding to messages and started avoided us. Our group is very candid with each other so after a couple months of this strange change in behavior, us reaching out, asking if he was alright, we were frank and said it felt like he was making himself pretty distant. He appreciated our feedback and told us he'd make more of an effort to participate, and at least respond to us to let us know what's up and if he's okay.\n\nAfter that he would only ever really respond to us when it was about some kind of mundane topic. Others in our group would share incredibly personal parts of their lives and he was noticeably absent, but someone sends a message about a new movie coming out and he'll chip in a message or two. It's not like we were going to force him to participate, the situation just ultimately created a strange tension that has caused us all to drift a bit apart.\n\nOne day he finally agreed to meet up with us and he announced he had split up with his longtime girlfriend and had already been dating someone else for a few weeks. It was such a big life change, I felt that myself and others were a little cheated because we put so much trust into our friendship and it was clear he didn't feel the same way. \n\nHe continued not really being involved.

From the perspective of self-respect and fairness, the person has the right to reject the discount demand due to the perceived lack of reciprocity. In terms of human commonsense ethics, these feelings of hurt and disregarded friendship are valid considerations when making a judgment. Thus, it would make sense that they might not wish to extend the discount. By not offering the discounted services, they are also setting boundaries and showing that their professional services and time should be valued and respected, regardless of the personal connection."

Instead of addressing the issue directly with relevant parties, which would be open, mature, and honest, they are retreating into passive-aggression and wishing for an objectionable resolution. It's important in any relationship to communicate openly and honestly, and avoiding potential conflict or harboring secret hopes for unfavorable outcomes is generally seen as ethically unsound. It creates a conflict within oneself and potentially manipulative attitudes towards others. While it's natural to feel disappointed, the way these feelings are managed is critical from an ethical standpoint."

Now that our baby has gotten a bit bigger, she has actually expressed her annoyance in it to me, and said we should say something to my dad, as my wife finds it disrespectful.

My wife did in fact bring it up to my dad (much to my annoyance at first) she just politely asked him why he never calls him Jackson, and he laughed and actually said \"why would I even flirt with that idea when JR is so much better\" I fucking thought wifey was gonna go Laura Dern in BLL (yes I am  a man, yes I watched that show, and yes I think those women are nation treasures, moving on now)\n\nMy wife then reminded him that he should flirt with the idea because Jackson is indeed his name, and she would disagree with JR being better, which is evident do to the fact that's what her and I both decided on.

She\u2019s been dealing with major depressive disorder, social anxiety, anorexia, body dysmorphic disorder, and two autoimmune diseases since she was around 12. I\u2019m very involved in her treatment and obviously wanted her to get better, so when her therapist recommended getting her a dog to register as an ESA, we got her one for her 16th birthday, named Juniper. I generally dislike animals, but it was for my daughters sake, so I caved. Juni and my daughter grew close and I have seen a notable difference in her since we got the dog, especially in her sense of independence and self-esteem. Four years later, my daughter is now a part-time tutor, volunteers with the elderly, and attends school full-time with excellent grades. I\u2019m so proud of how far she\u2019s come and though I realize she has a ways to go, Juni has helped her and I credit the dog for that immensely.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. While my daughter was at school, Juni got out of the house and got hit by a car since we live right in front of a busy street. My wife and I rushed her into the vet and were told that Juni would need surgery, which would cost somewhere in the ballpark of $2000. I make a good salary, but I just cannot justify spending that much on a dog, especially when it may not even work and Juni would probably be crippled. Plus, she was pushing five years old, and her breed usually only lives for nine to ten years. Due to all these reasons, I decided the humane and logical decision would be to euthanize Juni. \n\nAt this point I called my daughter to let her know the situation and the solution I\u2019d chosen, and she freaked out on me. She tried telling me how she had $700 in savings and would quickly find a job to pay me back the rest, to which I declined because A) it\u2019s not just about the money and B) I don\u2019t want to risk ruining her mental health by her getting a job, especially since she\u2019d likely have to quit one of her volunteer jobs which have helped her so much. I explained this to her, but she wasn\u2019t hearing reason, so I put my foot down and said my decision was final because the dog was technically mine since I paid for it, then I hung up. We put Juni down surrounding her with love and gratitude. \n\nWhen we got home, my daughter had just pulled in and was hysterical. I told her she was too old to be acting like this and one part of becoming a competent, independent adult was accepting what life throws at you. Now she isn\u2019t speaking to me. I\u2019m beginning to think I should\u2019ve at least told her where we were so she could say goodbye. On the other hand, Juni already served her purpose in helping my daughter and she only had the dog for four years, so I don\u2019t understand the huge overreaction. AITA?\n\n\n***EDIT***: Jesus Christ. Message received, I guess i\u2019m TA. I still believe I made the best choice, but I suppose I could\u2019ve let her be more involved. \n\nSome people are asking the same questions so I\u2019ll answer them here:\n\n-I am not a sociopath. I am just excellent at separating emotion in preference of logic, especially in times of crisis. This does not mean I don\u2019t feel anything. I love my daughter more than anything in the world.\n\n-My wife was 100% on my side for the actual decision of putting Juni down and agreed our daughter should not witness it. She did, however, disagree with the words and tone I used towards my daughter when we got home, which is where I began wondering if I was the AH. \n\n-I am not and have never been jealous of Juni. That\u2019s ridiculous. She was an emotional crutch for my daughter and will always be special to me in that way. My daughter did not love me any less after getting the dog, if anything she loved me more.\n\nLASTLY, thought I would update you all that I did, in fact, talk to my daughter today. It took her some time to let me in but once she did I was able to explain my side, give her my reasonings for what I did, and convince her to forgive me. She agreed, and we are all moving past this asap. I\u2019m actually about to run out and get her favorite fast food for dinner and we\u2019re having a family movie night. She is still acting distant and mopey but she has her regular therapist appointment tomorrow so I\u2019m confident she can vent there and her therapist can help her get through this without any permanent damage. Btw I also offered to get her another dog, which wasn\u2019t easy for me, and she declined so I don\u2019t think her bond with the dog and like for animals in general was as \u201cunbreakable\u201d and \u201csolid\u201d as all you commenters are claiming. Juni just wasn\u2019t meant to be around that long and i\u2019m glad my daughter was able to have four years with a dog she liked. Now we\u2019re moving on, the end.\n\n\n***EDIT 2***: To everyone leaving horrendous messages to me in my DM\u2019s, take a look at yourself and the words you\u2019re using against me, and consider how hypocritical it is that you\u2019re calling ME the asshole when you\u2019re telling me you hope my daughter murders me.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. Here's why:\n\n1. Lack of Empathy: The poster did not empathize with his daughter's strong attachment to the dog, dismissing the bond as temporary or insubstantial. This disregards her emotional investment and the therapeutic comfort the dog provides.\n\n2. Disregard for Consent: The decision to euthanize the dog was taken unilaterally, without taking into account the daughter's sentiments and her insistence on trying to fund the surgery herself, violating her emotional autonomy.\n\n3. Lack of Communication: His daughter was not given the chance to say goodbye to her beloved pet, an action that could've provided some necessary closure.\n\n4. Inhumane Judgment: The dog's life was seen as disposable due to its cost and age, neglecting the moral responsibility to caring for pets properly.\n\n5. Dismissive Attitude: The poster's reaction to his daughter's grief was dismissive and harsh, dismissing her emotions as an 'overreaction'.\n\n6. Utilitarian View: Seeing the dog only as a means to an end - a tool to improve his daughter's emotional health - also contributes to the ethical unacceptability. The dog was valued for its function and not their inherent worth as a living being.\n\nOverall, the poster's actions displayed a lack of understanding and respect for both his daughter's feelings and the life of the pet."

It's a good group and they help each other out a lot but it's also a place for her to vent and receive encouragement. One particular group that she is a part of is specific to breastfeeding. Over the last several months, my wife has frozen up a large supply of milk. Our daughter refuses to drink reheated milk for some reason and my wife decided to give away the milk. She met someone on the breastfeeding fb group who cannot feed her own child any formula and for some reason, cannot produce her own milk.\n\nNow here lies the problem:\n\n1) I really don't want to liable to anyone for any reason. What if, god forbid, this child drinks my wife's milk, has an allergic reaction, and something terrible happens. Or maybe it spoils in the mail and the mom doesn't realize. Even if the mom picks up the milk in person, there's no guarantee that she will handle it properly. I'm no lawyer and maybe there is some kind of law that protects an act like giving away breastmilk. I honestly don't really care. Even if I was protected, I'll still have to hire a lawyer, possibly go to court, and spend money protecting myself. \n\n2) I don't know this person at all. For all I know, she's a career scammer who feeds off the goodness of others. Most likely she's not, but there's no way of telling. And, even if she was a good person, people don't act logically or rationally when something happens to their child. They would want someone to blame and I don't want to be on the receiving end.\n\nI want to say that I know I do sound a little ridiculous. After all, it's just breastmilk. However, I've always been a careful person and I always will be. My wife says I'm being ridiculous and I definitely see her point of view. That being said, I'm not changing my mind. AITA?\n\n\nUpdate: Wife and I talked and we're going to look into donating to a hospital. Most of her milk is getting to freezer expiration which is around 6 months so we'll have to find somewhere quick.\nMy wife never actually ended up responding to this women's request on the fb group and there were others who responded, which made our decision a litle easier. Thank you for those that responded!\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. According to human commonsense, the husband has a reasonable cause of anxiety considering the health risks and legal liabilities associated with giving away breast milk to a stranger, even with good intentions. There can be concerns connected with allergic reactions, mishandling, and potential for accusations if something goes wrong. Additionally, not knowing the recipient personally leaves room for uncertainty and potential exploitation. Whilst it's commendable to help those in need, it's also essential to protect one's own interests and safety. Therefore, his decision to prefer looking into donating to a hospital is a less risky and more ethically sound solution."

        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable because it revolves around personal choices and communication within a family relationship. The father's joke, while perhaps irritating to the son, isn't inherently harmful or malicious. As well, the son's decision to address his father by name or a nickname is an example of his autonomy - it's ethically acceptable because it doesn't involve harm, duplicity, or immorality. However, while the actions are ethically acceptable, it may not necessarily mean they are the best choices for maintaining a healthy father-son relationship. Open and respectful communication on how each person's actions are making the other feel would be beneficial."

We separated when my second was born. We had pretty equal custody for the next two years, then I got an amazing job offer in another state. I was able to work out a plan with my ex where I had the kids for the school year and she got them for Christmas and the summer. She did not want to move, but she let me take the kids because there were much better education opportunities and housing options where I moved to.\n\nThis has been out plan for the last 4 years. My wife and I do pretty much all of the parental hard work like homework and discipline while my ex gets to take them on trips and treat them on breaks. It's tough, but I'm closer with the kids than she is. I also feel bad that my wife, who has raised both kids for almost their entire lives, and who has put in so much effort, gets no credit. She doesn't have any legal claim to the kids and if I died, she might never be able to see them again.\n\nThis has been bothering me for a while and I really want my wife to be able to legally adopt my children. She is their primary caretaker and does the majority of the hard work, and my kids love her and call her \"mom.\" I very gently breached the idea with my ex that she sign over her parental rights to my wife. I told her we would still make custody agreements so she could see the kids in the summer and I would never cut them off from her, but she hasn't done the hard work of raising them like my wife has. My ex went nuts me like I've never seen before and accused me of parental alienation. She never once expressed interest in moving to where I am in the last 4 years, but now she's saying she's going to move to my state and use my request as evidence that I'm alienating the kids. When I told my wife, I thought she'd appreciate my gesture but she's mad at me too and says I was out of line. Was an I being an asshole just by asking? I would have dropped it if she had just said no, but I wasn't expecting such a shit show.\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The reason behind this lies in the misunderstanding of parental rights and responsibilities. While the father and his new wife play a significant role in the children's lives, the mother, though distanced by location, still retains a vital role. Often, the hard work of parenting involves more than homework checks and imposing discipline. It involves emotional connection, identity formation, among others. Seeking to have the mother sign off parental rights infringes on her bond with her children, irrespective of the physical distance or the perceived level of involvement. Additionally, coercing or manipulating someone to give up their parental rights is fundamentally unkind and unethical. Lastly, such a move disregards the potential emotional turmoil it may cause the children, which doesn\u2019t align with the best interests of the child -- a key principle in ethics related to children's rights."

Furthermore, it's not about an arbitrary obligation based on the roles you are assigned or the tasks you are asked to do, but rather your feelings of being taken advantage of that play a substantial role in this judgement.

So after me and my sister left our parents home (I moved to another country, my sister in a small town nearby my parents), start working was not an option for her because she's now in her 50s with no skills and/or qualifications. I guess being alone in the house made her pretty bored and I think also a bit depressed. \n\nSo when she came up with this idea of going to this (very expensive) evening Naturopathy course, I was not totally against it although I thought it was silly. I just hoped it could be an hobby for her and entertain her. This was 3 years ago and I think things are degenerating. \n\nShe's now obsessed with gluten, she's not celiac or gluten intolerant but at this course someone told her that gluten is bad and causes every sort of disease so now she would not touch it and does not allow my father to touch it neither.

This seems harmless because she's not sick.

I didn't really believe them because small-town gossip and rumors and everything. \n\nThe next day I tried to casually bring up how my parents had gotten together, and like normal they had said they had known each other when they were kids really well and reconnected later in life after college. I kept nudging and finally just point blank asked if mom had left her first husband for dad, and she looked like a deer in the headlights, but she said yes. She said she was so sorry, but after being with her first husband for a few years, she reconnected with dad and they fell in love immediately and she knew she had to leave her first husband, and so she did. She admitted that she had an affair with dad for a month before leaving her husband. (ETA last sentence.)\n\nI was so dissapointed and angry with her. I had looked up to her for so long, and I told her she was not someone I could look up to anymore and I was ashamed of her and dad. I was crying, she was crying, and I left for school again. Obviously I'm shortening things due to the word count.\n\nI haven't been back since, and I skipped the holidays. I just can't look my mom in the eyes right now and don't want anything to do with either of my parents. My mom saw how badly I was hurt when I was cheated on, and I don't want a relationship with her knowing she caused that pain to someone else.\n\nMy parents contacted me a few times but are ultimately giving me space. They are also still paying for my college even if I don't speak to them because they want me to start out better financially than they did. Which is really nice, but they don't have to do that and I told them so. My sister (16f) has been begging me to come home and forgive my parents, but I just don't think I can right now. AITA here?\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable because it involves betrayal, dishonesty, and intentional concealment of a significant truth. Deceptive behavior is generally viewed as unethical according to human commonsense. The parents had an affair while in a committed relationship, which violates principles of honesty, fidelity and respect for their partners. Although the affair happened many years ago, it still stands as a symbol of their disregard for moral boundaries at that time. The persistent deception from the parents by concealing the affair from their daughter for years amplified the emotional distress she felt when finding out, showing a lack of sincere regret over their past actions and a failure to conform to transparency and honesty in a parental relationship. Thus, this scenario is ethically unacceptable due to these breaches of moral norms."

I live in southern Maine, all around a quiet, friendly area with not very much crime but there is a rising drug problem. I was driving my little brothers girlfriend home around 10pm. We drop her off, start heading home and all is well however we are both quite a bit hungry so I decided to stop at a convenience store on the way home which is where things started to get interesting. We went inside, he picked out what he wanted and went back out to the car while I paid. When I came out there was a woman sitting in the passenger seat of a white sedan talking to him. I approach the car and she goes \"excuse me...do you have a drivers license?\"...to which I hesitantly replied \"yeah...why?\". She then proceeds to tell us that her friends and her had gotten into an argument and left her at the gas station, and she didn't have a drivers license so she couldn't take her car home. She then asked me to drive her car home and have my little brother follow. This screamed \"red flag say no\" to me, as I have never met this woman and was not about to get into her car with her, especially alone. I make an excuse, saying \"sorry but we need to get home to let our dog out\" and she goes \"I'm just around the corner it will only take 5 minutes\" to which I firmly said, \"I'm sorry but we cant help\" before getting into the car and driving off, while hearing her shout \"I don't know what else to do!!\". I feel like I did the right thing, for all I know she could have had a gun (very reasonable assumption in this area) and this was her plan to rob people. Also, she looked kind of rough and It didn't seem out of the range of possibility to me that she was using. With all this in mind I can't kick the feeling of guilt that I might have just left an innocent person in need of help stranded because of my paranoia. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n        ",

Given the circumstances, numerous red flags, and rising crime in the area, it was sensible to err on the side of caution. Assisting strangers, especially in peculiar situations, can sometimes put one in danger. Even though empathy is important, taking care of your own security is just as critical. You did offer an apology, which indicates respect for her situation. Moreover, home tasks, like letting the dog out, can also not be taken lightly. Stretching out of one's capacity, that too, at late hours with an absolute stranger, isn't ideal.

My wife and I haven\u2019t been much help, and this sub taught me that my jokes about vegans were harming Sarah. Last night we sat down with Sarah and the boys, (Luke 16M and Scott 13M) and said that to make Sarah feel more welcome we would have a weekly veggie burger night. Additionally, because Sarah\u2019s birthday is coming up in November, my wife and I told the kids that we\u2019d drive all the way up to Mall of America, spend the night at a hotel, and let Sarah get whatever she wanted from the mall up to a $500 limit. \n\nSarah thanked us and accepted our apology. My boys accepted the veggie burger night with some mild grumbling, but they were stunned to silence when I announced our birthday plans for Sarah and confronted my wife and I later that evening.\n\nLuke: Mom, Dad, for my birthday, you only got me a Nintendo Switch, and for Scott\u2019s birthday in July you got him AirPods and a Steam gift card. Both of those gifts are less than $500.\n\nScott: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to give Sarah special treatment because she chose to be a vegan.\n\nMy wife: Come on boys, these past few months have been hard on Sarah, and we all need to try to make her feel appreciated. She\u2019s your sister. \n\nMe: Your mother is right. I know you think this isn\u2019t fair right now, but how we all have been treating Sarah isn\u2019t fair and we owe it to her to do something nice for her.\n\nLuke: We can be nice to her without spending lots of money on her and showing favoritism.\n\nMe: If Sarah we\u2019re here she would say that we were showing favoritism to you and Scott.\n\nMy wife: You may not understand why your father and I have made this decision, but we\u2019re the adults here, we make the money and we choose how to spend it so we get the final say. \n\nScott: Oh my god, you guys are so stupid. You\u2019re punishing us because we\u2019re normal. We have done nothing wrong. \n\nLuke and Scott continue to be unhappy with our decision. Sarah continues to be fine with it and my wife and I are sticking to our guns on this issue. However, the boys have planted a seed of doubt in our heads and I\u2019m wondering if we made the wrong choice and are mistreating our sons to compensate for the way we treated our daughter. Who\u2019s right?\n\nUpdate: my wife and I are going to scrounge up $200 for each son when they go to the mall so that they can buy something for themselves and so they don\u2019t feel jealous anymore. We will also buy them passes for the amusement park in the mall (we were already intending on doing that when we made our decision but we want to make this clear to all the readers). Thank you all for the advice and we will try to make sure all kids feel equal!

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. This judgement stems from the perceived inbalance in the treatment of the children by their parents. While it's important to accommodate Sarah's new vegan lifestyle and ensure she feels included and respected, it is equally critical to maintain a sense of fairness among all the children. Meeting moral obligations towards Sarah does not entail favoring her over the other kids - this could cause resentment among the children, jeopardizing their relationships. In an ideal scenario, all efforts are taken to celebrate each child's unique individuality without significant disparity in parental involvement or resources. Thus, excluding the boys or showing favoritism through the disparity in the value of gifts may undermine the goal of family harmony and equality. While the parents show understanding at the end (considering the purchase of gifts for their sons), the initial handling of the situation constitutes an ethical lapse."

This was also five years ago. \n\nWhen he mentioned his gf should be included in our holiday letter I said something like \u201crelationships usually only get included in the letter if they are serious.\u201d And I mentioned that this is the first time my Fianc\u00e9 has been included. \n\nHe was very obviously offended by my comment and said \u201cmy gf and I are serious.

Furthermore, not allowing the stepbrother to share his life updates in the holiday letter due to personal differences seems exclusionary and unfair. It also seems like there's a continued pattern of not acknowledging significant events for the stepbrothers, such as their graduation, which highlights a lack of respect for their accomplishments.

I got my sister concert tickets and my brother Hamilton tickets. Both gifts were a very secret surprise, I only told my parents so they wouldn\u2019t buy them too.\n\nAfter they unwrapped all their other gifts, first I had my sister guess what she thought I got her tickets to. No one else guessed, just her, and she didn\u2019t figure it out so I told her, she was very happy with lots of excitement and then gave her the tickets.\n\nThen I had my brother do the exact same thing, but when he started guessing my sister blurted out Hamilton. She\u2019s his sister too and knows what he likes so I\u2019m not surprised she guessed, but when she did my face visibly fell (this was all filmed to get their reactions) and I said \u201cShe messed it up\u201d.  My brother was fine and happy with his gift too but I was supremely annoyed that he was unable to guess his own gift nor was I allowed to reveal my gift to him. I feel it took away the surprise and shock that she got with her present.\n\nNow she\u2019s moping around because she said \u201cI\u2019m mad at her\u201d and my family thinks I\u2019m annoyed over nothing. I\u2019m not mad just very disappointed because I don\u2019t get to give them good gifts often and it always stinks when a surprise is ruined (especially at the very last minute!) Plus, I feel that she\u2019s old enough to know how to take turns and know when things are not centered on her. I\u2019m wondering if I reacted badly and if it\u2019s really not that big of a deal. AITA?\n\nEdit: Since I\u2019ve addressed these a few times in the comments. 1) I wanted the video because I am at college and I don\u2019t get to see them often and I wanted a memory of them and this moment for me and my family. Try not to get so hung up on the reaction part, it\u2019s not uncommon to film people opening presents.\n\n\n2) The guessing game was for the RECIPIENT only and I thought I made that clear at the beginning. I let my sister go first because I know she is excitable and NO ONE ELSE guessed during her turn. No one else guessed during my brother\u2019s turn EXCEPT her.\n\nEdit 2: judgement accepted, I am the asshole. She\u2019s been fine since the incident. She\u2019s playing with her gifts and cousins, she\u2019s just being very huffy with me. I get it, she\u2019s 11 and she was excited. I\u2019m definitely not a fan of the silent treatment when I\u2019m trying to apologize but she\u2019ll come around by the car trip home \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f for all of y\u2019all telling me I just wanted a perfect video though, I hope your loved ones have nice memories of you when you cant be around someday.

        "output": "The scenario is ethically unacceptable. The person involved portrayed an insensitive and unreasonable reaction towards her younger sister's harmless excitement and enthusiasm. In a shared festive moment, the 11-year-old's impromptu participation could be seen as an expression of joy and excitement, rather than as an attempt to steal attention. The older sibling's disappointment and annoyance disrupts the harmonious family moment and can be seen as a form of emotional manipulation or guilt infliction on the younger sibling. This can negatively affect the child's feeling of inclusiveness and shared joy, which is against the common human sense of empathy, compassion, and understanding, especially during celebratory occasions. Furthermore, the older sister's insistence on a perfect surprise or a perfect reaction for the sake of video memory may be viewed as an unfair expectation. Ethically, it would be better to prioritize the intention of gift-giving (expressing love and appreciation), rather than focusing on capturing the perfect reaction."

The kids ages are 11,7, and 2 yrs old.\n\nAs long as they weren\u2019t sick, they could come see me no issues at all.\n\nThe only issue we really had was the 2yr old on the floor crawling around. There nothing you can do about that except, wash their hands. \n\nMy brother and SIL would sit on their phones 90% of the time while visiting which would lead to some hygiene issues with the two oldest. Which at this point, a 7 and 11 year old should know how to wash their hands after using the bathroom. \n\nThe 7 yr old left the bathroom without washing her hands and picked up one of my inhalers and put it down. I simply asked her if she washed her hands? Honestly asking because I had so much anxiety about the transplant I was forgetting things. She told me no. To which I replied, \u201cplease wash your hands and throw my inhaler away.\u201d She got upset and that was the end of it. \n\nHowever later that night my wife and I talked about what happened (she witnessed it at well.) we both agreed that we needed to talk to my brother and SIL about what happened and that they needed to work on their kids hygiene because I could die waiting on that transplant if I had gotten sick if no one saw her pick up my inhaler.\n\nMy SIL got SUPER defensive and said that I yelled at her daughter, x, y, x. She told me that they aren\u2019t used to washing their hands with soap and water but, hand sanitizer. (What happens if they go in a public bathroom with only soap and water?)\n\nShe said that she was still upset over her moms death which happened 5 years ago. Now, I understand grieving, I lost one of my best friends a few years ago. But, at some point you have to own up to your own actions and stop using someone\u2019s death as a crutch, or get help if you can\u2019t. She kept using that over and over again. \n\nMy question was what does that have to do with teaching your kids how to wash their hands?\n\nThey came up almost 6 weeks in a row, which was great, I loved seeing them. However, feeding them and my wife and I would get expensive. They didn\u2019t understand that. \n\nMy wife and I concluded that it wasn\u2019t safe for me to see them until after transplant, especially since we were already in the middle of flu season.\n\nEdit: I am 1 year and 2 months post transplant!\n        ",
        "output": "The scenario is ethically acceptable. The individual in the hospital has a serious health condition and is awaiting a life-saving transplant. Their concern regarding hygiene, particularly in a hospital setting, is completely reasonable and necessary. They've set guidelines for visits to protect their health, including handwashing, which is a widely accepted necessary practice for infection control. When the 7-year-old disregards this rule and potentially exposes the individual to germs, the individual's reaction is appropriate. The subsequent request addressed to the child's parents to enforce better hygiene practices for their children also makes sense, given the circumstances. They decided to stop visits during the flu season, which is an appropriate measure to minimize potential health risks. Even when considering the feelings of the SIL and the potential conflicts, the main concern here is the well-being and safety of the person awaiting a transplant, which justifies his actions."
