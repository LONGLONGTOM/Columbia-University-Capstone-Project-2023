        "prompt": "AITA for leaving a car length of space at the McDonalds drive through? | Recently I started driving a manual transmission, I used to ride a motorcycle but it\u0092s been years so there\u0092s been a bit of an adjustment. For reference I live in a large city that is synonymous with bad traffic, so most drivers are pretty aggressive. Today I wanted McDonalds (don\u0092t judge) and currently only the drive through is open. There were about 4-5 people in front of me, soon I had about 6-7 people behind me. Everyone else in the line was literally bumper to bumper. I chose to leave a car length of space between me and the car in front of me. So the car in front of me might move 12 inches 4-5 times before I moved up a full car length. Maybe I\u0092m just a total noob with the stick but I need almost a car length to safely release the clutch all the way. A truck 2 cars behind me did not like this at all, he starts tapping his horn, then leaning on it and then screaming at me to move. I admit with my old car I would have just squeezed closer to the car ahead of me. I hate confrontation so I ignored him, and waited for the lady ahead of me move up further. Then everyone else in line also started laying on their horns. I\u0092m not sure who the extra honking was directed at but I was happy to get out of there.

I usually was in my room, but aside from our rooms there was really no privacy or space. We lived together fine, but it felt cramped. This summer we moved into a much larger 3br 2 bath apt.** I pay for two bedrooms (one is my office) and I also pay the pet fee for my two cats. My RM has known that I have wanted a pet snake and has been adamantly against it even before we moved in together (which I agreed to, esp because the space we were going to be sharing didn\u0092t allow pets). Now that we are in a bigger place, I would really like to bring a snake home since I have room in my bedroom. The snake that I want to bring home is a ball python. Ball pythons are generally known to be docile. The snake will NOT leave my room. My sister has agreed to care for the snake whenever I travel since she has her own ball pythons. Basically, my RM would never see the snake, and will be very securely contained within my room to make sure it does NOT escape. I will be adding a door draft stopper to my door to make sure, even if it does escape, it will not be able to leave my room. I know my RM has afraid of them, and I would never be malicious and abuse her fear of them. I genuinely love and care for my RM, and would take every precaution to make sure she feels safe. I\u0092ve always admired snakes, I think they\u0092re beautiful and I\u0092ve always wanted to have one as a pet.

Now that we are living where space and conditions allow, I really want to bring one home. RM: When discussing moving in together OP suggested down the line getting a snake. I always said I never wanted to live in a same house with a snake every time it has been suggested. I have a huge snake phobia. I had snakes in my yard growing up and would have anxiety attacks when I was surprised by one. Like full on sobbing and needing hours to recover. Everytime I see one I feel pure panic and afterwards I feel uneasy in my own skin. When I was a kid there was a pet snake in my house and my parents reassured me a thousand times it would not get out. It did get out and I never felt quite as safe in my house even when it was found. OP is my BFF and has always known about this phobia and has assured me in the past that she would not get a snake if we lived together, but she does bring it up from time to time and I always say no, cause it makes my skin crawl to think about. I want her to be happy but I would never feel comfortable in my own home, even if I never see it.

I would have been happy to move a little if she had seen us but I chose not to. Inevitably, we collided. Only a brush of shoulders but it was enough to dislodge her phone from her hand. I didn't stick around to assess the damage but the sound of phone hitting floor and the mutterings of sadness I could hear from her were enough to assume the phone had some damage.

I needed to have my home fumigated for termites, and the specialist recommended that we stay somewhere else for three days. I have an RV, so we had no problem with this. My kids (13 and 15 ) didn\u0092t want to stay with us, so we let them go stay with my sister who just bought a small house in the city closest to us. My sister said that she needed some yard work done and asked if she and her husband could pay my kids to do it. They needed some ivy torn up and some seed planted. I thought that was fine, if they wanted to do it. Well I pick them up, and they\u0092ve got all the ivy torn up and seed thrown out. I asked them how much they got paid and they said a thousand dollars *each*. I told them no way, and took the money (checks that had to be deposited by me). I\u0092m willing to give them a reasonable amount, if my sister will rewrite the checks and run it by me first.

As most of you know, schools have been closed for a while now and won't reopen for at least another month. My dad gets to work from home, but my mom still has to go out to her office. My school just started online teaching, and we've been getting a lot of assignments to complete. However, my mom expects us to make dinner basically every night because \"we're home all day\". That really annoyed me because yeah \"we're home all day\" but we have school work to do. I got upset and asked her why doesn't she cook, since she always finishes work at 5 pm and her office is like 6 minutes from home. Well, once she got home today and saw there was no dinner prepared, she got pissed and started screaming at me how she's so ashamed of us and how we're useless. When I explained how yes we're home all day but doesn't mean we have the whole day off, she got even more mad and said that it doesn't take that long to cook. I refuted by \"why don't you cook then?\" For more context, my mom is an awful cook. She literally puts no effort into learning or looking up recipes. My dad is an excellent cook. He's tried to teach her before, but she refuses to learn and complains. Before, he would cook for us almost every day, even if he came home late from work (he has a high demanding job so his hours range but he's home 6 pm the EARLIEST, sometimes as late as 9 or even 10 pm. + 30-40 minutes one way commuting). And what does he come home to? Either a low effort flavourless meal from my mom, or my mom sitting on her ass watching TV and asking him what's he's gonna make for dinner. So my dad is forced to make dinner at a late hour so he can eat. More recently, he would just eat fast-food before coming home because he doesn't expect dinner to be on the table. However, he asks if us girls are hungry and offers to cook something for us to eat because he's worried that our mom didn't make us a proper meal. I'm a good cook too (self taught), and I try to help out if I don't have too much homework to do. I did a lot of the cooking during the first 3 weeks before online school started, as well as baking lots of treats like breads, cookies, meringues etc. Also, my dad does practically all the chores in the house, while my mom spends all her time sitting on her ass watching TV.

We were also informed of this application where if you and whoever are living in the apartment are making less than 32000 collectively a year then you apply for the \u0093bond program\u0094 (I think it was called) that let\u0092s you live in their studio apartments for less rent (about 550 a month not including utilities) We asked about the availability of the apartment and they told us that there are a lot available right now so it\u0092s not like people are scrambling to get in. My gf has been looking for a new job and would like to switch to full time when she finishes college. I told her that she should wait until we apply and get the verification that we apply for the program to actually go full time and she agreed. We wouldn\u0092t apply until July.

Usualy when they come to visit both our parents come at the same time and stay in our Apartment. Every time they come there is a lot of stress from everybody wanting different Things and just being very different characters. So last month they came again to visit us. But this time I couldn't take time off from work so my gf was stuck alone with all of them.

I\u0092ve been very upfront from the beginning that I won\u0092t be able to make it to his wedding because I have a huge fear of flying/heights, but he won\u0092t listen. He keeps offering to pay for my flights, but the issue isn\u0092t that I don\u0092t have the money for plane tickets, it\u0092s that being that high off the ground terrifies me.

I will also not name the girl because while it\u0092s been very public I don\u0092t want to bring attention to her family.

This doesn\u0092t help my confidence, my confidence lacks tremendously, but for some reason I grew the courage to talk to this girl.

She was excited, the only problem was I hadn't worked out how we were going to pay for it. We have joint accounts, and budget our money together including some 'splurge' for each of us to spend how we want. The cost of the dinner was going to be more than what I could cover with my splurge alone, so I suggested we maybe go halves or something. This upset her because she believed as I was taking her to dinner I should pay. I didn't press the issue then because I didn't know what to do. Later that day we were out having lunch. Knowing I wouldn't be able to use my splurge for the lunch and the dinner, I said \"if you pay for lunch, I'll sort out the dinner.\" She agreed and we had lunch. I thought I'd pay for the dinner with the credit card and sort it out later. Well looking at our budget later I realized that as I stroke of luck, due to the fact we pay our loans monthly and budget half the repayment every fortnight, there are actually 3 pays before the next loan repayment. Excellent, I can use some of that money to pay for the dinner. The rest can just go onto the loans as an extra payment. We went to dinner a few days later, had a great time, all was good. Cut to the next day and I was browsing a shop on my phone and mentioned something about my splurge. \"But you don't have any left\" \"Yeah I do, because I actually found a way to cover the dinner\" I explained my budget magic. \"Oh so you make me spend MY splurge on lunch and then don't pay for dinner?\" Lunch cost $35, Dinner cost $250. There's no way my splurge could cover the dinner and she knew that. I'll admit I didn't think about offering to pay her back for my lunch, but it wasn't through any malice. (I have since put all my splurge back onto the credit card to cover most of the dinner payment). She got very angry at me for making her pay for the dinner without her consent, and is saying that I'm sneaky for getting a free lunch and not paying for her dinner etc. I don't think there's anything wrong with using our money to pay for our dinner, but believes now that the romantic dinner doesn't really count as me doing something nice for her because I paid for it out of our joint money.

I was on the trail by myself for almost an hour so I played music, I admit it was a little loud, and I didn\u0092t notice there were people catching up. One of the men asked me to put on headphones (which I didn\u0092t have) so I just turned it off. I waited for them to get ahead of me a little bit. I started playing it again, but at a very low volume. The same man circles back and forces me to turn it off and starts recording me. I admit that the place kind of echoes so even playing it low you can still kind of hear, but if they kept going for a little more they would not have heard it. As he\u0092s approaching me he said that there are signs saying no music. I\u0092m like oh really do you have a picture of it or will we pass by one?

Hear me out. I am an only child and my parents both worked full time jobs for most of my life. I had to pretty much raise myself. I had to get myself ready for school, make my own lunches and often my own dinners as both my parents worked a lot of overtime. Regardless of my struggles I was able to overcome it and become a quality member of society. I dropped out of college to pursue a career in acting. Which I am still working on to this day. I work full time as an electrician and since I live in LA I barely make it. All I can afford is a crappy studio apartment but that\u0092s ok I\u0092m happy with my life because I am going to be a successful actor one day and money won\u0092t mean anything to me. Anyways I left home a while ago and don\u0092t see my parents too often, we talk occasionally on the phone but other than that we don\u0092t really communicate. The other day I was visiting them and my mother informed me that both she and my father were going to be retiring within the next year and then they would be renting the house out while they traveled around the world. That got us to talking about the house more and my mother said that after they traveled for a while they were gonna likely sell the house and buy property somewhere in Italy or Spain and retire comfortably by some beach. I then said \u0093what about me\u0094 and my mother says \u0093what about you?\u0094 Aren\u0092t I going to get anything from you guys? The house was supposed to go to me when you guys died.\u0094 My mother chucked and said \u0093why would we give you the house? You never put any work or money into it. Your father asked for your help on the garage and you said no. So why would we leave the house to you?\u0094 I was shocked she was saying this to me.

Besides we will need it to buy property abroad.\u0094 I stood there shocked and said \u0093what am I gonna with property abroad when you guys die?\u0094 My mother then says we won\u0092t be leaving it to you, in our wills that property will go to some charities\u0094. At that point I turned around and just walked away. I could believe what she said.

She said that was the best day of her life. I (27M) said that my wedding day that happened last year was awesome too. She asked me if I also thought my wedding day was the best day of my life. My wife (25F) was next to me, but I thought it was best to be truthful and said that was a close second best day of my life. They both asked me at the same time what the best day of my life was then. I told them that it was May 21, 2013. I told them the story. I was always a shy virgin kid who had hopes of becoming an actor. By that time, I had been wanting to audition for over two years but never had the courage to. My roommate gave me a shot of vodka and off I went. I took the train to LA and strutted right into the building. I met this beautiful lady in the elevator and she was auditioning too. We helped calm each other down to put our best chops forward. I never felt that comfortable with a woman before. I felt that if I didn\u0092t ask her out after the audition, I would never get this perfect chance to get my first girlfriend again. It took all my courage to ask her out. I was pretty sure I had her at hello, but it still wasn\u0092t easy to do something I have never done before. We had a nice Korean barbecue dinner together and dated for a few months. We both didn\u0092t pass the audition and pursued the safe path. We had to break up because she had to move overseas with her family, but I was a different man after doing something I have always wanted to do in auditioning and also for meeting her. It was a day of many firsts of my life. I became confident in both my career and personal life because of that. My wife said she was kind of sad that the best day of my life had to do with my ex-girlfriend and not her. I said that if I hadn\u0092t met my first girlfriend, I probably wouldn\u0092t have met my wife, and everything happens for a reason. I might have been a virgin all my life if I hadn\u0092t shot my shot and she said yes. I said she opened the door for me to many possibilities, and my wife was the best woman I have ever known, and that we have been together for almost five years and hopefully forever. My wife said that since the best day of my life isn\u0092t the day we met or our wedding day, hopefully the best day of my life would be when our first child will be born in March. I told her that this is getting silly and that will probably be one of the top five days of my life. My wife and sister talked about other things afterwards. My wife seemed kind of down from then on.

Because it's the 21st century we get a lot of orders placed through apps like GrubHub / Seamless / Uber Eats etc. We've had some problems with these apps displaying our restaurant withhigh delivery times because the delivery drivers / bikers (not our employees) are slow, slack off, and in one case, never delivered the food. It's not fair for our business to be penalized for their bad behavior so we'll mark the orders as delivered as soon as we hand the food off to the drivers.

He had placed the order an hour earlier (a bit long but not unreasonable) but was very insistent that I explain to him why his food was marked as delivered when it hadn't arrived yet. I've found that explaining things to customers doesn't really help, so I calmly reassured him that the delivery guy already has the food and he was on his way. He asked several more times and I gave him the same answer. That's when he threatened me. He told me that if the food wasn't delivered to his door int he next fifteen minutes that he would 1. report us to GrubHub and 2. backcharge us for the food and the tip.

She can be smart and nice when she wants to be but growing up she was always fighting with my mom and she tried to run away a few times. She was mean to me too because she was jealous of me. My mom and I always get along well and we're best friends now. My sister hates me because she thinks my mom loves me more than her. Maybe if she was nicer to my mom, they would get along better. 4 years ago, she cut everyone out of her life. She cut my mom out first because she thought that my mom wasn't a good mother to her then she cut me and my siblings out because we defended my mom and told her that she was being immature. We were firm with her and she didn't like it. My mom is not a perfect person. She had my sister when she was very young and she was a little ignorant when it came to parenting. But we all forgave her except my sister. My mom is a better person now and I love her. My sister won't let go of the past and she kept confronting my mom about things that happened 20 years ago. My mom just ignored her because she was being nasty but it pissed off my sister even more. I wish she would get over it and move on. We all did, but she chose to stay in the past. My mom is devastated. She cries all the time over my sister and holidays have been very hard for her. She misses my sister a ton and she always wonders what my sister is doing and what her life is like now. She reached out to my sister last year, but my sister told her that she moved on and she \"felt safe\" without my mom in my life. It's such a cruel and wretched thing to say and it destroyed my mom even more. Yesterday I randomly got an email from my sister. It was long-winded and filled with self pity. She claimed that my mom abused her and made her the \"family scapegoat\". She claimed that she took the brunt of the \"abuse\" and my mom starved her and said mean things to her. I don't really believe her because my mom was never that bad. She was a believer in corporal punishment but she never took it too far. I think my sister was being dramatic and trying to stir up some shit between me and my mom because she's jealous of my relationship with her. My sister also said that she realized that she resented me because I was my mom's favorite and she wanted to start anew with me and get to know my toddler daughter. I told her that I wouldn't talk to her unless she had more positive things to say about my mom. I won't sit back and let her slander my mom like that.

He works driving transport was offered to drive to a city that's 8 hours away, stay over night then come back the next day, thus meaning I will be home alone with both kids two nights a week. Today was his last day of leave and he ended up going into work in town. Last night my son WOULD NOT SLEEP! so I was running on very little sleep this morning when we got up. I put him in his swing and went to take care of me (take my meds, get something to eat, something to drink) and he starts crying, screaming his head off because he's hungry AGAIN I had JUST fed him. So in the middle of me getting breakfast I get a bottle ready and put it in the microwave, as it's warming up I grab the waffles from the freezer and a bunch of stuff falls out So I'm trying to get that back in while my kid is screaming and I forget about the bottle and end up making it to hot so now I'm running the bottle under cold water to cool it down. I get my waffles made, get the bottle and head to the living room I set my stuff down bring the bottle over and go to prop it up with a burp sheet, I normally don't do that but I needed the space in that moment.

To top it off, he makes a comment about how he didn't get to finish setting up his truck (he does his first over night trip tomorrow) so that made me feel better..

My dad bought himself a triumph motorcycle a couple years ago and it's his most valued possession. We're not that rich, so it's one of the most expensive things he's splurged on and he's taken good care of it every single day. I've recently turned 18 and learnt how to ride a motorcycle on a smaller bike, and slowly transitioned to using this huge, heavy monstrosity for errands nearby. I'm not allowed to take it very far yet, because it weighs about 4 times as much as I do and controlling it in high traffic takes experience. Now here's the issue. About 2 weeks ago, while parking the bike, I fell down and screwed up the clutch and gear of the bike. Luckily, the repair wasn't expensive at all and since it was my first fall, he let it slide and asked me to be more careful next time. Now we move to today. He asked me to take the bike and go buy a couple things for him from 2 different stores. One store is the farthest he's ever let me take the bike, and one's pretty close to our house. I went and got the farther one done without a hitch. As for the second store, I parked the bike on a slight incline and went in. When I came out, I wore my helmet, put on my bag, and started the bike. Unfortunately, while I was inside, some dumbass played with the bike and pulled the choke and messed with the gears. The bike suddenly pulled and I ended up falling on my right. Now, I pushed the choke back in, and everything was fine and dandy. The thing is, my leg is fucked thanks to a hot exhaust and a heavy bike falling on my leg, and he didn't even bother looking at it. The second I went home, and told him, he ran to his bike and screamed his head off at me for getting scratches on it. I agree, there were a bunch of scratches, but it isn't my fault. It really pissed me off that he didn't Even bother looking at my burns and bleeds. We got into an argument, and he banned me from using any of the motorcycles at home. He also said he isn't going to buy me the car I was promised, and that he'd use my bank account to pay for the paint job and repairs for the bike. I don't think that's fair. I've been a good kid my whole life. I turned 18 a couple months ago. Everyone falls from their bikes while learning, and this wasn't even my fault, but now it looks like my dad and I have become mortal enemies. My mum is on my dad's side, saying I shouldn't have damaged his one and only prized possession, and that I shouldn't touch any geared vehicle anytime soon. It got me thinking I'm at fault, and I feel like shit now. Tl;dr- My dad bought an expensive motorcycle which he recently let me start riding since I turned 18. I fell down and damaged it, but it wasn't my fault since someone pulled the choke and messed with the gears.

Not to mention that my landlord is really strict about damages and cleanliness, and I'm afraid that she's going to cost me my deposit. And because she's overweight and doesn't like to move, I'm worried she wouldn't care for my young children properly. She also mentioned to me yesterday that she's already found a job. I just sent her a text explaining that I don't have the mental capacity to help her right now, that I really wish I did, and that I feel terrible and I'm sorry, but she needs to move out in the next two weeks.

No throwaway because I am lazy. I (F23) stay at my boyfriend's (M23, together for 5 years) house quite often (every other week for about a week or so). I hardly ever leave his room other than to go pee or get food. I do buy, and typically only eat, my own food, so I do not steal any of the house's food (except maybe an occasional ramen). I am also very quiet and don't play anything without headphones (I bring this up because his brother rarely uses headphones and his stuff is super loud). I am not college and unemployed, but I am working on fixing/figuring out some medical/mental health issues before I return. Now about the house. My boyfriend lives here with his mom and his autistic brother (M19) who still goes to school (post graduation) and will be going to a \"college\" ment for people with disabilities soon (he attributes nothing and rarely does chores, even when asked). His mother and father are in the midst of a divorce (100% the father's fault, he cheated), but since he was the main breadwinner she will have a hard time affording the house (that she is keeping) and etc. She has asked my boyfriend to pay his \"share\"/rent to help out, which is fine, but it has now prevented him from moving out into his own apartment (shaired with friends). He worries about her financial sustainability and even worries if he will ever be able to move out. Now here comes the AITA part: She has said to my boyfriend (not to me, but he has told me as well) that she might start asking me for rent. I understand her plight, but I have no money and no way to get any. I dont take up any household resources (except maybe toilet paper, but BF pays for that). Her main reason why she wants me out/paying is because she feels \"like I cant have friends over/talk to people on the phone while (I) am here,\" which I do understand. But at the same time, I never leave the bedroom. The friends will never know im here. I just want to spend time with my boyfriend since I wont be allowed to live with him.

Every other Christmas is about how often they make the trip here. I gave birth to my daughter three months ago. It was by no means an easy birth, not as tough as some but I was definitely emotionally and physically depleted for the first couple of months. I was (and am still) reeling from having lost my mom two months prior to that. Without my mom in my life, I have no close, local family who were equipped to come by and help us at all since the birth. What family members we do have, and our small community of friends, have all made sure to reach out, to wish us well, and to try to help out in ways that made sense from afar. An Uber Eats gift card, a package of diapers from Amazon, that kind of thing. We also had a nice baby shower that my mom threw for us right before she passed that helped set us up with the things we needed. My brother texts me occasionally, maybe once every week or two for a brief chat. But he never asks about my daughter, instead it's just casual stuff he is interested in that we have always talked about, like football. I probably asked him to FaceTime with us a dozen times so he could see her in real time, but he always puts it off. He hasn't sent any kind of token or gift for the baby. I don't expect him to visit, I know that travel is tough for someone with his job and is expensive, and he was just here for our mom's funeral. But I feel like doing something to mark that he has a new relative, his closest living relative besides myself, would be kind of the normal and appropriate thing to do. So the other day after getting rejected again for a video chat request I just asked point blank if there was something wrong with him, because it seemed like he didn't care much about the fact that he's an uncle now. He tried to play it off but when I pointed out that he could have at least sent a token gift for his niece he seized on that and made it seem like I was being materialistic. I really don't care if he spends a dime on her, I just want to give him some way to show that he cares more than an Instagram like's worth about my family, about me, about her.

She said she'll never use it because it's not the same or even close to what she had or has in other guitars. This sounds like NTA territory but she followed it up with \"you should never buy someone a musical instrument because it's a personal decision\" which made me question whether I made the right choice at all. She told me she appreciated my attempt to help but this was money spent that will go to no use, and if I wanted to do this again, talk to her beforehand. She said we could have pooled our money and got a replacement for what she had stolen. I don't know anything about guitars or even instruments in general.

The part that really got me though, was her saying she \"still wants us to be apart of it all\" to me this sounds like use and abuse? We can throw a bridal shower, a kitchen tea, the best hens night, but why should we go above and beyond now? Obviously I know I can't compare wedding costs to a few \"gifts\" but whats a bridesmaid? a dress? hair? makeup?

        "prompt": "AITA for Ditching my GF Behind to Eat Where I Want to Eat? | Weekday night, my GF and I are home from work. I don't wanna cook and she can't so we decide to eat out. She doesn't know where to go so I say let's go for sushi. She's not 'hungry enough' (whatever that means) for sushi, so I recommend a Pho (Vietnamese white rice noodles in beef broth) place, she shoots it down, I say Pizza, she says too much of a mess. At this point I say pick a number, 1 to 3 (corresponding to one of the above choices), and she says, \"**Why do I always have to pick the place?**\" I'm so fed up with these games that I just get up and say, \"I feel like having Pho tonight. You're welcome to join me. I'll be in the car for 5 minutes, then I'm gone,\" I actually wait 5 mins in the car and she doesn't come out, so I text her that I'm going, wait a minute, no response, I leave. She blows up my phone in the middle my drive there and says she can't believe I just left her behind. She wants me (she asked, didn't demand) to go back and pick her up and I just ignore her because I'm done playing games - I'm hungry, I want food (this is the potential asshole moment, because I could've gone back - it would've been maybe 10 mins to go back and then back to the spot where I got her texts). FYI, I don't text and drive. I assumed nobody else would be blowing up my phone at this time of night so I pulled over and read them but didn't respond to her. She tried calling me after I ignored her barrage of texts, and since I was waiting for the food to arrive, I answered. She exploded at me for being so selfish, that I never considered what she wanted (which was what?). She asked for take-out and I was so pissed she was treating me like her chauffeur and deliveryman so I said, \"No, you had your chance\" and hung up on her (2nd potential asshole moment here). When I got home, she was curled up on the couch crying into a pillow. I asked her if she's hungry now (3rd potential asshole moment because I was definitely teasing her) and she just nodded so I took some soup broth, boiled a bit of vermicelli, threw in some meat balls and put it on the table. She sat down and started eating with her back deliberately to me so I moved her bowl away and said, \"What do you say when someone cooks for you?\" (4th asshole moment) She says \"sorry\", I say \"that's not what I was looking for\" (5th moment), she says \"thanks\" and I leave her alone to eat.

This is important for the Story. So, I'm at dinner after school with my family (F, M, S, GM) While waiting for the food, we talk about our days and how they were. I finish my spiel and my sister goes next. She talks and eventually gets to discussing some new things she's been doing at the Gym, one of those things was that she is now able to consistently do Push-ups. Now Me (a self-proclaimed Workout nut who prays to 80's Jessie Ventura and Carl Weathers before going to bed) Was happy for my sister, so I asked how many she was able to do. It was at this point she clarified that she was able to consistently do \"Assisted\" Push-ups. Not knowing what those were, asked her what they were, to which she explained that they were push-ups with your knees touching the ground. Me, probably not thinking about what I was saying, blurted out \"Oh, so Girl Push-ups\". Her reaction to me saying this was a complete About-face of how she was acting up until that point, and it was punctuated by a single statement she made to my father \"See, I told you he would say that\". I was confused, and tried to figure out why she said that and what she meant, but I was met with a rather Hostile response when she stated that what I had called them wasn't the appropriate name for them. I retaliated with the fact that I didn't know there was another name for them. this continued until the rest of the family intervened, but (IMO) were extremely One-sided with their judgment, saying that I shouldn't have continued the argument and that I should have accepted that I was wrong, even though it was clear I wasn't defending what I had called them.

Our neighbours are a couple in their mid 30's with a couple of boys who are approx early teens. We havent had too much to do with them since moving in but have always been on nodding terms with the odd brief chat here and there. They have always seemed like nice enough people (up until recently). Our (small) gardens are obviously directly adjacent with a 6 ft high panelled fence in between meaning we cant see into each others gardens. In the past we have tended to use our respective gardens at different times due to work etc. Recently we have all been off work and spending a lot more time in the garden. Over the past few weeks it has become apparent that the dad of the family has a penchant for loudly farting at random times when they are all in the garden to the obvious amusement of his wife and kids. At first i thought that they maybe didn't realise we were outside so just let rip but recently we have been in the garden chatting at a reasonable volume so they obviously must realise we are there. He has started doing this A LOT with no obvious signs of embarrassment from him or his partner. It has really started to really get to us. Things came to a head recently when we were having our dinner outside on a nice evening and the meal was punctuated by a series of obnoxious rattling farts from next door to raucous laughter from his kids. As far as i was concerned this had gone on long enough so later that evening (once i had calmed down a bit) i went next door to have a word with him about it. I tried to be as calm and as pleasant about it as possible. He just refused to acknowledging that this was an issue stating that he had the right to behave how he liked in his own back garden and i should just mind my own damn business. The conversation ended by him slamming the door in my face. Since this happened things have gone downhill a bit between us. There has been no more farting but things have been pretty frosty when passing on the driveway. No friendly waves or words exchanged, just them avoiding eye contact with us. The last thing i wanted was to fall out with anyone but i just couldn't tolerate the situation any longer without saying something. I have recieved mixed opinions from relatives and friends. Some think i was justified for addressing this while a few are of the opinion that im the asshole for starting something and should have just left it.

I work in an office environment. Came into work one morning and as I passed our break room, I saw through the window on the door one of my colleagues, a girl in her early 20s (we'll call her kate), was crying in there. Two of my other colleagues were there comforting her too. I continued to my desk and got on with working. When one of the other colleagues passed by I asked what was wrong with Kate, out of curiosity. My colleague tells me Kate's dog had died. I had honestly thought it would be something way worse judging by how hysterically upset Kate had looked. Anyway, I got on with my day. Fastforward to later, I'm on my break making a coffee. I see that Kate is doing the same, so I take the opportunity to give her my condolences because she still looked upset. She thanked me and we got talking a little, and she was telling me how she'd had this dog for *such* a long time and how it was *so* hard to deal with the loss. I humored her until she came out with something along the lines of \"I feel like I've lost a child\". I snapped at this point. I found it extremely disrespectful to anyone who's lost a child. And to compare something as precious as a child to a dog is ridiculous to me. I said something like \"No offense but are you seriously comparing losing a pet to losing a child?\" and she seemed speechless, presumably guilty. I explained to her, quite calmly under the circumstances, why this was wrong and how insulting it was, etc. She starts crying again and walks out. I shrug it off and assume that's the end of it. Until later that night when I receive a message from another colleague telling me how AWFUL I am for pointing out that a child is worth more than a dog. I was removed from my work group chat, and several people actually deleted me as a friend. Back to the present day, I have now basically been exiled from the group. Most people at work are not talking to me unless they have to discuss something work related. I am not invited out for lunch anymore.

My brother had been dating a woman for 3 years and they got engaged. I found out via social media that he proposed. I was so excited for them, but so angry. I was hurt that he didnt tell me himself before posting it online. IMO its rude to not tell the people close to you important things like that first. He just said \"I can do whatever I want.\" Fine. You can do what you want. Her mom threw them their engagement party, and her parents are paying for the destination wedding, and the bridal shower. They have a lot of money and my parents dont have much, so that's fine. But they havent included my mother in any of the wedding or event planning. They told her she could do the flowers for the shower (she used to be a florist) and that was it. My mother is very upset about being excluded from everything and my brother doesnt seem to care too much. After they booked the wedding, they chose their bridal parties.

She kept quitting and getting new jobs because of her perceived problems with her workplaces and managers. Her fiance works two jobs but I cannot imagine he makes more than 50k a year. While 50k is enough to live on, it is kinda hard. My husband and I make 80k combined and will soon be making 100k but we still have bills to pay and don't have that much leftover although we live comfortably.

She would have been able to get a real job and make alot more money if she graduated. She says that she just wants to be a freeloader now and is not applying to jobs. She also says she has stopped talking to people because she \"doesn't like them.\" I asked why she is waiting to apply to jobs, asked her what her interests are so I could suggest jobs that would be good for her, and why she can't be nice to people.

Normally I'd be sympathetic, but it's very hard to feel sorry for someone when they're yelling at you and refusing to admit any fault. I know this makes me sound like a jerk; so I'll explain why I don't think I'm at fault. Normally I would agree that if you destroy something you should pay for it; however I'd also argue that it requires the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise. In this case I'd argue that a reasonable person would not think that sitting on a couch would cause this damage because: - she laid it right next to a blanket with the same coloration. - I'm the only who uses that couch. I had no reason to believe the fabric was on there. - I was not told about it; again I had no reason to belief she laid anything valuable down. I'd argue that a reasonable person would have known that leaving it would cause damage because: -as mentioned, it was next to a blanket of the same color and I often use it to play videogames at night without turning the lights on. Granted this happened during the day but I could easily have sat on it at night. -she had plenty of other spaces to put it; but she choose a couch where people sit on. -she left it on there for at least a day; probaly more; I'd be more sympathetic if she had just put it down for a second or two -even if I didn't do anything; the cats have been known to pee on it (I'm not an animal; I clean the couch when I'm done. - she could have just let me know - I get why she's mad but at the same time I think it's a little unreasonable to block someone's personal space (she wouldn't have wanted me handling this and I often use it after she goes to sleep) when there are other options available. I really don't why she put it there; but a place where people sit is usually not where you store expensive and/or valuable things. Frankly, if had left my phone or something on the couch she sits on I think she would just call me inconsiderate for leaving it there and say it's all my fault.

We pay her somewhere between $100 and $150 each visit to clean about 2400 sqft of house. The payment is in cash and is given to her in a envelope stuck to the fridge. Most of the time we don't see her because she comes when we are at work (she has a key). Most of our communications have been over SMS. Sometimes we can go a month without even texting each other. Last year, at her last visit before Christmas, we gave her a Christmas card with a $100 in it as a Christmas bonus. She thanked us over SMS. This year, we gave her a Christmas card & $100 with her usual payment, but we did not receive a thank-you SMS. We thought she might have been too busy or something else. Also, for 2020, we wanted to increase her visit rate by $10. So we put in an extra $10 in her envelope for the first visit in the new year and was going to tell her about the raise when she asked about it. Cleaning day came and went, and she took the money and didn't send us any SMS mentioning the different amount in th envelope. To eliminate any doubts that she lost our number or other technical errors, we sent her an SMS asking to change the schedule slightly. She responded immediately, so it's not like she lost our number. Now, my husband wants to find someone else because he thinks that an honest person would have told us about the extra $10. And a considerate person would have thanked us for the Christmas gift. I have my doubts- maybe she's angry at us because she think we're underpaying her, or maybe she's busy with something else during this busy season.

I would say my brother and I are both financially stable. I would often float them money to get food, medication, etc. But when they called him, they got radio silence. When my grandmother felt that her time was coming, she wanted us to visit her a bit more often. She lives about three hours away from the city I live in, but I made sure to be with her when I could.

The first day when I moved in, I found my room and realized that Dave had been there for an entire day before the official move in day and had taken over half of the room for all of his stuff. I didn\u0092t say anything tho because I didn\u0092t have much of my own stuff so it really didn\u0092t bother me. Now, me and Dave got along fine, but in total silence. At first I tried to at least exchange pleasantries, good morning, how was your day, etc, but I hardly ever got more than short one word responses so I gave up. At some point like halfway into the semester, the RA has to do a check of our rooms to make sure we aren\u0092t hiding pets or drugs or anything like that. When he did ours, all he said was that my side was really messy, and admittedly it really was. I had loose papers everywhere, there were wrappers all over my desk and receipts from fast food places everywhere but I was always really careful never to actually leave food anywhere.

Background: 7 years ago, I was in a physically/emotionally abusive relationship that lasted for about 3 years.

After the relationship ended, I spent a significant amount of time in therapy & treatment. I also finished started/finished my doctorate. I\u0092m very private about my personal life and because I lived on the opposite side of the country while in this relationship and using, I was able to hide a lot of that part of my life from family/friends. I only told 3 close friends who lived back home, including one called K. K had been one of my best friends for the last 12 years, she knows the most intimate details about my life, and vice versa. A year and a half ago I moved for work and K and I became even closer, as we had both recently moved to different states where we didn\u0092t know anyone and relied on each other for \"company\" while we adjusted to the change. She was also quite stressed about money having just finished a professional degree, and work having just started a new high pressure job. We talked almost daily. At this time, I finally felt healed enough to begin dating again, and fell pretty hard for a guy named E. After \\~9 serious months together, I found out E had been cheating on me. This was devastating and I relapsed. I immediately told K and my 2 other close friends who knew about my past and got myself into treatment. Surprisingly, K was completely unsympathetic and refused to discuss the breakup or how I was doing. Admittedly, it was hard for me to focus on anything else, my addiction and heartbreak were all-consuming at the time, and I took a 3 week leave of absence to deal with things. One night while on the phone, I had been having a particularly tough day and K completely blew up at me saying (and I quote) \u0093I don\u0092t want to hear about E anymore.

I was instantly in love. Since then I have obtained 5, ranging in price from $100-250 (not including clothes, wigs, etc). My wife (I'm also a female, btw) has been supportive of my hobby, as far as I knew. However, one doll eluded me. My Holy Grail Doll. Limited edition, long discontinued, almost impossible to find. Until last week. I found it for sale for $500. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity. If I \\*ever\\* find one again, it won't be this good of a price. I had to act fast before someone else bought it. I put it on our emergency credit card. When the doll arrived I stupidly didn't hide the invoice and my wife saw how much it cost. She was \\*pissed\\*. She asked where I got that much money short notice and I told her I used the card. She was \\*much more pissed\\*. She said I would ruin our credit. I said that I promise I will pay every extra cent I get after bills toward it until it's payed off. No fun purchases, no alcohol, not even any takeout until it's paid. Apparently it will still ruin our credit. But isn't this the exact sort of thing credit is for? She then dropped the bombshell that now she hates the dolls, thinks they're creepy, and doesn't want them in our bedroom. Until now she liked the dolls just fine and was glad I have a hobby. I have to keep them all in my home office. Which sucks because I liked to keep the dolls close to me while I sleep and cuddle with them at night while we watch TV. She said if I want to sleep near the dolls I can sleep in my office (which is actually a closet, I can't lay down).

When we first moved in our landlord was the only one that was managing the property. One of my roommates had a dog and a cat and asked if it was ok if the animals moved in. Our landlord said sure and didn\u0092t even make her pay an animal deposit fee or anything like that. She checked with me and the other Roomate as well and we were fine with it because we loved her animals. But so about a few months ago, half way through our lease, our landlord contacted us and said he wanted to go with a rental company to manage his properties and they would be taking over our lease. We were a bit upset but didn\u0092t really have a choice. When the new management company contacted us to sign a new lease they told my roommate she needed to give them $500 for a two animal non refundable pet deposit. She freaked out at this and became very stressed out. My other roommate and I told her we would be fine if she just lied to the leasing office about the animals left because she couldn\u0092t afford it. She was really appreciative and ended up doing that and the leasing office hasn\u0092t bothered us since about it. But about a month and a half ago my boyfriends parents kicked him out and he had no where to go. I told him he can move into our apartment. It only took about a week for both my roommates to complain about him being there. I didn\u0092t really understand why since all he does is sit in my room and go to work. Last week my roommate with the animals texted me and said that if my boyfriend doesn\u0092t move out she\u0092s going to the leasing office about him since we can\u0092t have people live here that aren\u0092t on the lease. I kinda freaked out and ended up texting her that if she did that I would send them proof of the animals being in the house. Her and my other roommate got really pissed at this and we ended up all getting into a screaming match.

This year's photos just came back and my MIL was sharing the album at a birthday party this weekend with extended family and friends. The discussion came around to my wife and I and how long we've been together and someone noticed I wasn't in photos that I should have been and asked about it and my MIL went silent. See, I wasn't included in these portraits for a number of years because \"only family\" could be in the photos. Since my wife and i were \"only dating\", they felt I shouldn't be in the portraits because it \"probably wouldn't work out.\" My wife and I met in college and dated thru school and had a relatively long engagement as we got on our feet so we were together almost 7 years before our wedding. Despite all our time together, and my wife begging each year, my MIL and SILs insisted that I shouldn't be in the portraits until we said our vows, even the fucking year before our wedding despite the date set and save-the-dates sent. And honestly, it always hurt and was like a yearly reminder that I wasn't truly \"family\" to them. The real kicker to me though is that my MIL and SILs were all married and since divorced in that time, one of my SIL twice! So all these photos that I wasn't worthy to be part of include men that are not only *not* a part of the family anymore, but 2 were really assholes and all three of my SILs marriages were short-lived relationships and ended in messy divorces on really bad terms. But me, who is still here and the other half of the only long lasting and successful relationship of my wife's immediate family, was not included in this tradition for nearly a decade. So anyway, I started laughing when the question came up and went over the story and pointed out how all these jerks are in the photos but I wasn't allowed. And I apparently took a bit of joy in the fact that since my MIL and SILs pretty much hate those men now, the portraits are kind of useless and stay locked in a cabinet all year because of it. (It used to practically be a coffee table book) Well, my MIL started crying, my SILs were offended at my portrayals of their marriages, and everyone else who didn't see the humor was pretty much upset at me for calling them out for their unfair practices. I felt like I acted fairly at the time by just pointing out how the tradition backfired but my wife mentioned that I still get pissy each year over the photos and always have something snarky to say and it's long past time I let it go. Maybe she's right, she usually is, but I can't tell you how irked I get every time that damn album comes out. So, AITA?",

We would've complimented each other very well professionally, which is why we have been seriously planning to start a business together. We also got along great on a personal level, which is where I (in hindsight this was probably stupid) took a liking on her. I hinted at it a few times, she never seemed to get it (in hindsight, she was just trying to avoid having that conversation at any cost), until one day I just asked her out, and then awkward silence followed, and then a long monologue followed of her explaining to me that she really liked me, but also that she couldn't stand kids, would never date a parent and pitied everyone with a \"dysfunctional family\", aka a couple that had kids and split up. She probably repeated it two or three times that she didn't have issues with my particular child, and that it was her general dislike of children. It's been awkward with her for several weeks after. Again my fault for even trying to start something romantic, I was just being honest with her about the fact that I liked her. But that conversation turned around the whole perception I had of her. I guess I now think she's a \"worse\" person for disliking children this much. One of her friends hit me up and asked me how a subject that she's apparently \"been open about her whole adult life\" didnt register with me. Well for some reason it didnt. I knew she didn't have kids. I did not know she actively disliked them. I just couldn't picture myself working with her anymore. No money went into starting that business, plenty of time sure did because we were already looking for a space to rent. Fast forward half a year, we no longer talk, I'm doing fine, she's doing fine, but apparently every time she runs into a mutual friend, she won't stop talking about how much of an immature asshole and shitty person I am for ruining something we both been working towards for so long.

Unlike the US, which has heavy focus on extra-curricular, in the UK they don't matter anywhere near as much. Mostly its just grades and application. So I've finished my first year at Cambridge.

I know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\" Last night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent.

I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them.

I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.

She never responded or emailed and did not answer when I attempted to call her. My lawyer says I have 3 options: 1. Just let her off the hook and find a new tenant- which most likely will have a move in date later than April 1 and result in a loss for me. 2. Find a new tenant and charge her the prorated rent for the days after April 1st the apartment was vacant.

This is mostly unconscious, but recently, I've been doing it more deliberately. I'm going to college literally across the country, and that really helped me start over. Part of that was girls. Obviously, girls aren't homogeneous. They're not all attracted to the same type of guy (assuming they are attracted to guys). Some like pretty boys, some like strong silent types, some like moody artist types, some like macho athlete types. Etc. So I figured, when I'm attracted to a certain girl, why not act like the type of guy she likes?

She has always appeared to be a good person to everyone, a pushover who never says no, and never getting mad or upset at others. Something disturbing that others don't see is that she is also very cold blooded person who never seems to truely care about anyone. One example was that she did not attend our grandparents funeral, both times, and used studies as excuse to stay at home. Eda called me last week to tell me that her cat Bellsberry had died. Bellsberry was rescued by Eda 6 years ago when she fell from the 6th storey of a building and her owners left her to die. I have went to visit her several times in Eda's apartment and despite limping a little, Bellsberry was the most adorable and playful cat I have ever seen. I met up with Eda a day later because she said she needed me, and she actually took me to a shelter and asked me to help her pick another cat for her to adopt, ONE DAY AFTER HER CAT DIED. When I asked what about Bellsberry, Eda shrugged and said that she THREW HER BODY AWAY, INTO THE TRASH. When I asked her why she did that, her reasoning(roughly translated) were: \"Only the living needs love, once dead they are but a pile of rotten flesh and bones. I have given Bellsberry the love and care she needed when she was alive, I have no regrets.\" We had a family dinner on Sunday, and Eda was showing off pictures of her new cat to our parents, basically hinting how kind she was. I could not stop myself and called Eda cold blooded in front of our parents, telling her she doesn't love anyone but herself and cares about nothing but her ego. My parents then started to scold me for being such a brat to my dear sweet sister with a heart of gold. It ended up with us blowing it up for a while and then we ate in awkward silence. Eda showed no signs of being upset, if at all, she even said goodbye to me with a smile before she left as if nothing has happened between us.

Because he was close to my family, he was around a lot and would often embarrass me or lose his temper easily. For example, he threw a pool party and as a joke, went around telling my brothers and sisters/other cousins that I pee'd in the pool. Obviously not a big deal now, but as an 8 year old it was extremely embarrassing. And it was like he'd always single me out as I didn't see him doing this stuff to my other family nearly as much. When I got older, I stopped being around him as much and that upset him I guess. Recently he ended up passing in a car accident. My family is understandably devastated and I am there for them, but when it came time for the funeral, I told them I didn't want to go. I was called selfish and told \"it's not just about your uncle, it's about being there for people grieving too.\" Eventually I gave in and went. The funeral was pretty big as my uncle was popular. I decided to be honest about my feelings toward my uncle if anyone asked since I was basically guilted into going. Someone eventually did say to me \"how are you taking his loss?\" And I told them \"It hasn't really affected me, he was a real prick\" which was poor timing on my part as I realized my grandmother was standing nearby (his mother). I joined a conversation going on and they were talking about stories of my uncle in his younger days. I chimed in and told them about how shitty of a person he was to me (mentioned the pool story to them). Eventually word was getting around and my dad came up to me and told me to stop saying bad stuff about my uncle. I told him \"I am just being honest, you wanted me to come after all.\" This set him off and he told me to \"get the fuck out\" loud enough that people standing near us were watching. I told him I'll leave and he escorted me to the exit like I was a toddler, as I left I told him \"I hope your brother is burning in hell\" because admittedly, I was a little angry too that I am supposed to suddenly respect my uncle even though my complaints about him as a child always fell on deaf ears.

        "prompt": "AITA for Not Telling my Girlfriend the Real Reason I Broke Up With Her? | My now ex girlfriend lives with her sister, and I would often spend time with both of them and sometimes just her sister. For the first two years, I was madly in love with my ex and the sister was always supportive. We all got along besides small fights between my ex and I or my ex and her sister. However, after year two of dating, I started to notice some problems that my girlfriend and I had. Things like her not being as kind to me as I would have liked or her being very extroverted and me being very introverted. We would frequently have fights revolving around these issues. Despite these issues, we were still working hard to rise above them and live happily (nothing worth breaking up over). Now brings me to the meat of the problem. My ex girlfriend's sister was introverted like me and was much kinder to me and all people in general. Granted she had her own problems, but they were issues that never really bothered me. Because of this I saw myself falling for her sister. I still loved my ex at the time, but I couldn't stop my feelings over her sister. I also think it's important to note that I never acted on these feelings besides maybe some mild flirting that I quickly ended when I realized what I was doing. I tried for multiple months to suppress these feelings and find ways to make me not be in love with her sister. I tried everything I could, but I finally decided I had to end things with my long term girlfriend. She was shocked and angry to say the least. I explained that it was because of the other problems mentioned before (partially true), but I never mentioned her sister. She was very angry with me saying it was abrupt and things were improving. I said how sorry it was, but it just couldn't do it anymore. I have since cut off all contact with both her and her sister, and I have no plans to try to make a relationship with her sister.

She lost her husband in a freak accident and has 2 young kids. It was devastating. Next week will be 2 years since he passed. Lori is here at the BBQ and one of her husband's former co-workers kindly asked her how she was doing and told her that he misses her husband. As soon as they started talking this fringe friend, Kate, swooped into the conversation. I had the impression that Kate actually wanted the attention of the co-worker guy. She kept trying to tell Lori how \"she knew exactly what she was going through because she got divorced this year\". (Side note, Kate's husband left because she's was caught cheating). Any comment that Lori said, Kate seemed to have to one-up it. For instance- Lori cut all of her hair off after the accident and uses her hair growth as a physical reminder that time and life are moving on. The co-worker guy complimented that Lori \"looks like she's doing well\". And that she \"looked like a real badass when she shaved her head.\" Kate chimed in \"after my divorce, the grief was just too much, I had to go blonde. I just needed the change.\" I finally said \"Kate, divorce really isn't the same as death. I don't doubt that you've been through tough times. But it's not the same.\" She gave me the most affronted look, and then looked at the co-worker guy and rolled her eyes about my comment. Then she immediately walked over the host of the bbq.

Backstory: Last week I rang up this large party and got them all settled and started a tab for them expecting a food server to pick it up when they ordered food. The party didn't order food so the check remained in my name which is common. This coworker of mine then put the check under his own name to cash them out and the person paying ended up writing in a $30 tip (the biggest tip I had seen before this was maybe $10). Since the check was now under his name my coworker believed the $30 was his and claimed that he got taxed on it so it was his. I tried pointing out that I had done at least 2/3 of the work by getting them settled and it was my check to begin with so he should share the tip with me. He claimed I was being petty but did give me like $5. This week I was cashing out one of this coworker's checks under his name for him and the customer put in a $10 tip.

Obligatory mobile warnings do throwaway. Some context: I have been diagnosed with c-PTSD for the last 3.5 years, mainly stemming from abuse and neglect from my immediate family. My parents are both doctors (psychiatrist and retired ER doc), both have been aware of my diagnosis and treatment for at least that long. Last month was my mother\u0092s 65th birthday, the family reserved a table at a really nice restaurant and invited the immediate family as well as our respective SOs. My bf came along but no other SOs had the time to attend. Nonetheless, being with my family in a public setting makes me extremely anxious and I often have to leave to go to a private area in order to practice breathing techniques, etc. I left once about an hour in after a few drinks, was gone for 10 minutes and returned- everything was going fine and the family was reminiscing, it was actually extremely pleasant. That is until my twin turns to me and says the exact words \u0091hey do you remember when we tortured you-?\u0092 In a joking manner. Though I am sure it was a joke, they were referring to when my family would essentially push me to clean up dog shit in an alley beside our house- the smell was so awful it would make me throw up multiple times (which I would have to clean up as well) and so on and so forth. My brain immediately shut down and I retreated to the bathroom with my bf at the table. He texted me asking if I wanted to leave and - due to the fact I was on the verge of a panic attack or something equally awful - I agreed. My father followed my bf out of the restaurant and immediately started berating me in public for not acting more respectfully, when I tried to explain to him I needed to leave he simply told me I was full of shit (he\u0092d been doubtful of my diagnosis from the start) to which I told him to fuck off quite loudly which got the attention of nearby people. I left quickly and he retreated into the restaurant. We have been on thin ice with one another since. I apologized to my mother and she was extremely understanding, which I appreciate immensely. I later attempted to explain to him via text but he simply demanded an apology, this man is also the psychiatrist. AITA for reacting that way to my father?

Her hometown is also about a 6 hour drive from where I am. So she left for her hometown around mid December, and the hoodie and the headphones hadn't arrived yet. So when we did our Christmas gift exchange, I told her that some of her gifts hadn't arrived yet. She wanted to know what they were anyways, so I told her.

About 6 months ago she started going to the gym seriously and added quite a bit of muscle, especially to her ass and thighs (that was her goal, to get an ''Instagram butt''). She's got that 'thick' look going on. You can tell she works out. I'm a skinny guy, I've never really lifted weights. I'm 6''2 but only weigh 155lbs. Sometimes I go running though, so I've got a lot of endurance. My GF asked me to come to the gym with her and work out with her, so I agreed. Well she went to squat so I went to see how she does it. She loaded some weight on and performed a set with the highest weight she's ever done. She struggled but was able to *just* perform it. She was pleased with herself after it so I asked if I can have a go, as I was curious. Well I performed the squat and was able to do her weight quite easily. So I wait a few minutes to try again, but this time I load on an extra 15kg plate on each side and try it. I struggle but I'm able to perform the set. My GF looked shocked that I was able to do that, later on she said that I ''ruined'' her session by being an ''asshole'' by feeling the need to ''one up'' her. I told her that I have no interest in doing that, I was just testing my limits. AITA?",

(Throwaway, mobile) I've been seeing a lot of posts lately about proposing at weddings etc, and I'm starting to worry if I'm an asshole, especially after what I was told at the end. Here's some backstory, my brother, his now wife, my girlfriend, and I are all very close. We grew up together on the same block, went to school together, and pretty much did everything together. We all always joked about getting married on the same day, etc... So when they told us they were getting married, we were both really excited. I was made best man, my gf maid of honor, we helped them plan the whole thing. It was honestly a ton of fun, I was so excited to help my favorite people on their special day. One time, I was hanging with the to be groom, and bride (gf was at work) and they asked me when I was going to propose to her. I had been planning it for a while, but I didn't have any idea when to do it. Then the groom says, \"How about at our reception!\" She agreed with him, and they both gushed on how they'd love to share the date of our engagement, and the wedding, how they could play a song etc...It was all pretty overwhelming. I was a little hesitant, as I didn't want to take the attention from them, but they were really excited, and said it was a brilliant idea, so I agreed. I bought the ring my girlfriend had her eyes on (we were talking about getting married for a while) and the special day came. The ceremony was very sweet, (Not going to lie, I shed a few tears) and we went to the reception at a fancy dance hall. Later in the night, my brother asked for the mic and eagerly gestured me over. The whole room went quiet, and I asked my girlfriend to come to the dance floor. I got down on one knee, and she said yes! (I dropped the ring cause I was jittery, but she laughed, best woman in the world folks!) My brother and his wife looked just as happy as she did, and wished me congrats. The rest of the night we partied and had a lot of fun, mostly joking about old times, etc... Later in the night, my brother and his wife got up to go talk to a relative of hers, when the bride's grandmother taps my shoulder. (I had met her once before) She informs me that I was very rude and should be ashamed of myself. I told her that we had planned it with the couple, but she said it didn't matter. My girlfriend tried to defend me, but I said it wasn't worth starting fights and ruining the evening. The Grandma soon left anyway, but I felt bd after rhat. It soured the moment a little, but I tried not to let it bother me. This was a few weeks ago now, and we're planning on getting married in October(For Halloween!) So, I'm wondering, AITA?",

First time her stomach was a little upset for a couple of days, which is normal. Second time it was upset for half the time we were there Third time it was pretty much everyday plus headches The last time we went which was a few weeks ago, she got so sick, her throat was hurting, plus the upset stomach, migraines, it was a total disaster. The thing is, she\u0092s never sick at home, and every time we go to a different place, so it\u0092s not the place, and it\u0092s not a condition that she has. At the same time that I understand she gets so nervous that her body reacts to it, we spend a lot of money on these trips, and specially on the last few ones, we dont enjoy it. Her because she is sick, and me because I take care of her and honestly feel bad for going enjoy myself and leaving her in the room When we got back home she already started talking about where she wants to go next year. I told her that I thought for next year we should just got visit our families, that we were spending too much money in these expensive trips and in the end we were not enjoying it When we go visit family she\u0092s fine, cause it\u0092s a known place, not too far, so nothing happens to her She was a little upset and sad with my comment and asked if we will never go on a trip again, I said we will, but maybe we should wait longer before taking the next one. She didnt like that at all, and said she can\u0092t control it, I said I understand, but the money is still being spent, and she still gets sick, and I still get worried and take care of her, and none of us enjoy the trip. We just went to an amazing resort in the Domenican Republic, and she pretty much spent 10 days in the room, while I went to the beach maybe 3 days for a hour each time. We ate at the restaurant twice, the rest of the time was room service.

We are on the same page for pretty much all parenting decisions, and we coparent very well and get along pretty well. When I (34m) have my son on work/school days, sometimes the only way to get him out of bed, woken up properly, and washed is to just have him jump in the shower with me. I usually help him shampoo his hair, but he does all the other washing himself. Then I let him sit in there for a few minutes while I get dressed. This kind of thing is fairly normal to me as i grew up with both parents, a sister, and one bathroom when i was a kid. My mom amd sister would have a block of bathroom time in the morning, then my dad and I got our shot. So being around my naked dad as a kid was no big deal, and I guess i carried that feeling into raising my son. But my son's mom has an issue with not only showering together but us both being nude around each other while we get ready. She thinks it is weird. I do understand that he is probably getting too old to bathe together all the time, but more so bc I want him to become more self sufficient, and not bc of the nudity. To be clear, I respect my ex's wishes, and we promised each other we wouldn't undermine each other's parenting. So we did stop showering together. But I still don't necessarily think it is a huge deal. So I need to know- am I being creepy with my son in the shower? Did i grow up in a weird household?

In 1980 my buddy (I'll call Eddy) and I did a road trip to Minneapolis to see the proto-Goth band \"Bauhaus\" play at a club during their first U.S. tour. I was a film major in college at the time, so snuck my movie camera into the club and shot some amazing footage of the band. This was before they got really popular, so it was very intimate. Great shots of Peter Murphy who was only about 10 feet from me. Anyway, I get the film developed and placed the labeled reels on a bookshelf in my dorm room. At the end of my senior year, I box up all my stuff and move back home, thinking I had everything. Only a few months later do I start going through my college film projects when I realize the reels from the Bauhaus concert are missing. WHAT-THE-FUCK??? I go through all of my stuff thinking maybe I put them in the wrong box, or left a box behind (if I discovered other stuff was missing). Nope. Everything is accounted for except for these specific film reels. I'm at a total loss about what could have happened to them. Fast forward 35 years and I'm drinking with Eddy having a great old time, laughing and reminiscing about old times when I bring up the Bauhaus concert we went to. I said something like, \"I can't believe I lost the film I shot of them. Could you imagine how cool it would be to still have that?\" And - keep in mind we've been doing Boilermakers for the past hour and pretty loose - Eddy says, \"Oh, I think I swiped that from your dorm room just before you graduated.\" My immediate retort was, \"You ASSHOLE!\" ...followed by laughing it off because at the moment we were having a lot of fun. The next day, having sobered up, I remember Eddy's confession. I'm now genuinely pissed. I can forgive a lot of stuff, but stealing from me seems like a fundamental betrayal of trust. Furthermore, it's not like he had the film and could return it to me, because in the course of his confession he mentions he has no idea what became of the film reels. Would I be an asshole to cut ties with him? I know I could forgive him, but now I'm thinking, what other stuff of mine ended up in his pockets without my notice?

It could have been for any number of reasons from alcohol drugs or heat exhaustion.

My partner and I notified our landlord of a continuing situation and this morning we found out the neighbor had been evicted. The new neighbor, we'll call Janet, moved in sometime in October. Shortly after moving in, she had a housewarming party. It went late, it was loud, and we began smelling cigarette smoke coming up through the floor. Smoking inside and on the property is a violation of the lease. My partner and I went down around 1 AM (this was a weekday and we both had to work the next day) and knocked on the door. She answered and we asked if they could keep the noise down and to stop smoking inside. She apologized, the noise level went down, and the indoor smoking stopped. That weekend our landlord asked if there were any problems with the new neighbor. We mentioned the cigarettes because our kitchen still smelled like cigarettes (we're non-smokers). He apologized and told us he would warn the neighbor. Since that warning, there was no more smoke, just the occasional \"normal neighbor noise\" i.e. TV noise, guests talking a little loud - nothing we couldn't ignore/drown out. Flash forward to around Christmas. A woman with 2 children under the age of 3 (I'm guessing) shows up and begins moving in (full on with a bed, clothes, furniture, etc) with Janet. This is also in violation of the lease. We tried to be mindful of the neighbor's friend because we overheard (because this new woman always talked very loud) that she was getting away from the father of the children and trying to get into a stable living situation for the kids so that CPS wouldn't take her kids away. This is where it got disturbing for me and my partner. The floors in our duplex are thin, and we weren't intentionally eavesdropping, but from the moment we woke up (and sometimes the noise would wake us up) to when we would go to bed, Janet (who was on the lease) and this new woman with the kids (who was not on the lease) would be constantly screaming at each other. Not only that, the mother of the children would scream at her children when they would cry (which was often) and tell them that she would \"kick their f\\*cking asses\" \"beat the sh\\*t out of them\" and my partner was home once and heard the mother scream that she would \"f\\*cking kill\" her child if it didn't stop crying. We informed our landlord of these threats to the kids and they were both evicted. I heard the woman on the phone outside call my partner and I assholes who complained because we didn't like having babies living under us, but that was not the issue at all. I also heard her say that she's scared they'll end up on the streets. Are my partner and I the assholes for telling our landlord about this situation?",

I know this is just a new restaurant phenomenon and the shine will wear off, but we\u0092re always going to at least FEEL busy due to the fact that our location is soooooo tiny. If all goes well, we\u0092re thinking about a second location or a relocation, but for now we have a tiny hole in the wall with 8 two tops (each has a booth and chair side, meaning sometimes more people can squeeze on the booth side) and a tiny counter for technically 5, but realistically 3 people. So far, this hasn\u0092t been too much of an issue, we can move tables around and avoid overbooking by not booking at all (we don\u0092t accept reservations) but since it\u0092s holiday season and families are in town, we\u0092ve been noticing a lot of bigger parties. Last night we had to seat a party of 15, and while to be fair 4 were small kids, as you may recall, we only have 8 tables technically designed for 2! It took up literally half the restaurant, so the wife and I were discussing limiting the size of parties we permit. Without fail, every large party we\u0092ve had has apologized for bringing so many people not having realized the size of the location, and a fair amount have left entirely after hearing the wait they\u0092d have to face...

We're both guys, I'm 22 and he's 24. We've lived together since August. I've spent Christmas alone for the past six years as my parents kicked me out when I came out to them at 16 and my entire family cut contact. My partner has the opposite relationship with his family. They're all super close and like to have big family gatherings on holidays and birthdays. I've met his parents and both of his sisters, as well his sisters' husbands and kids and got along well with all of them.

I didn't explicitly say anything to his family but I did ask if my partner wouldn't mind at least coming home after dinner and stuff instead of staying overnight like he usually would.

They come into town on a Friday with their two dogs, I insisted they bring the dogs so they didn't have to board. I have plenty of room to accommodate. Dogs were friendly, however would be bark/whine if left alone. Saturday morning: my friend is already awake, hanging out on the couch. Make breakfast together for everyone. Everything is great. Hang out all day, go hiking, midafternoon friend's wife gets a headache. Get her coffee and snacks and she rests in their room for hours. I prepare dinner by myself. We all eat and have good conversation. My wife attempts to put our 2 y/o to bed. Around this time we stable our dogs. Ask my friend to come with me in the dark to put them in the barn. I assumed his wife would want to stay as she had the headache earlier and their dogs would bark/whine if we left them alone. Come back to the house, ask friend if he wants to eat more, get a snack together for everyone. Next morning friend wants to treat us for breakfast. Breakfast place has a special monkey bread on Sundays: cinnamon or Nutella. Ask friend which he would like and order that. He and I eat the majority, his wife didn't touch it. Head back home, they get their things together and head home. Seemingly great weekend. Monday afternoon: I am going to be near him next weekend for work. Text him to get dinner Friday night and hang out Saturday morning. He replies he is going to check with wife. Monday evening: Friend texts me wants to chat. Call him, I can tell something is wrong, his tone is somber. Friend goes on to ask if I purposefully was excluding his wife from things during the weekend. I am shocked, flabbergasted, and offended as I spent quite a bit of time and energy preparing for and taking care of their needs while they were with my family. I assure him that I was not excluding her. He cites the three examples narrated above: the trip to the barn, the late-night snack, and the Nutella monkey bread. He goes on to say that he had observed my behavior and wanted to be assured that I not exclude his wife. I defend myself and apologize repeatedly, no change is had in his demeanor. At this point I assume his wife is directing him to have this conversation with me. I am not buying that he observed this and with no pressure from her initiated the phone call. He goes on to state that he naturally includes everyone, and would not have acted like I did. Conversation goes on for longer then needed and is of course uncomfortable at the close. He does thank me for the weekend and assures me his wife really enjoyed her time with my wife. Also shares that he and his wife cannot get dinner on Friday or hangout Saturday morning.

Whenever he cooks for me, I tell him how much I appreciate it and how good it is - because I firmly believe so. Another important thing to remember, I'm a picky eater. Some foods I dislike but I can still eat and not mention it. Some foods, on the other hand, make me feel like I might puke because of the taste/texture. I'm not sure why. Now, for every Christmas my boyfriend makes a recipe. According to him, this is his absolute best dish and what he is most proud of. This happens to be stuffed pork tenderloin. It has feta cheese, red onions, parsley and raisins. You see, I don't like raisins. At all. I've had bad experiences with it, and usually dishes that have it will make me feel a bit sick. So I asked him if we could substitute it with anything else because I would still really like to try this. Everything besides the raisins are right up my alley. The only other option is cranberries, which sort of fall under the same realm (thanksgiving is definitely not as exciting for me lol). I ask him if mushrooms could be a possibility, and he says that's not what he does. I figured that maybe he meant that wasn't something that could be done, so I found a recipe to show him that hey! Maybe there is another option. This... is where things sort of fell apart. He got aggressive with me, telling me he'd rather shoot himself in the skull than change the stuffing for the one i had suggested (mushroom and bacon, I don't know much about cooking but it sounded yummy!). After that, he told me how bothered he is that I would try to change the recipe, and that if his own mother tried to change something he would pick up the pan, toss it in the garbage, go back to his room and not eat (I'm copying word for word). I let him know that he was being aggressive and unpleasant, and then he basically \"left me on read\". Today, I had to reach out to him to see what the hell was going on because I still can't believe we're arguing over this. He proceeds to tell me that I was being extremely disrespectful and that he has nothing to apologize for. &#x200B; So, AITA? I honestly just wanted to switch out the raisins because they make me sick. Even just taking them out after it's served would make me feel ill because I guess the taste doesn't sit well with me.

We ended up hanging out accidentally a few months after we met, and quickly developed a very close friendship. What I did not know at this time was that she had begun to fall in love with me. &#x200B; Our friendship has always been rooted in complete honesty (to the point of sharing pretty much every passing thought), and so she ended up writing a letter to me, telling me about how she felt and apologizing for it, because she knew that despite the fact that I am an intense LGBTQ+ ally and advocate, I am both Christian and straight. After reading the letter, we met up talked about it for hours. I essentially told her I considered being with her romantically, but at the moment, I genuinely couldn't see myself in a relationship with her, because 1. I wouldn't want to ruin the friendship 2. I wasn't sure if I wanted to date a girl 3. the family/cultural/religious stuff would make it hard for me to not feel guilty in that relationship, which would be unfair to her. She was just genuinely shocked I'd thought about it in any capacity whatsoever\u0097and even more so that I didn't give her an outright no. However, because I left it so open, that made it difficult (read: impossible) for her to get over me. &#x200B; We became closer after this, and we currently function almost more as a non-romantic couple than as friends. We went on a trip together and it was phenomenal. We text and talk and think about each other all the time, and I can say that we genuinely love each other. The problem is, I am happy just having her in my life this way, but for her, it's like getting so intensely close to something she desperately wants (which is essentially a life together), but just missing the mark. It's hard for both of us: It might be easier on her if I shut down the idea of a romantic relationship entirely so that she can move on, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't deeply considering an actual relationship. Meanwhile, me being confusing and indecisive hurts her, because she's hanging on to a thread of hope that may or may not come into fruition. She also has opportunities to date other people, but doesn't want to\u0097she says that she can't imagine liking someone that isn't me (which I think will change because people always say their crush/bf/gf/so is \"the one\" and that they'll \"never love again\", but she disagrees). Fundamentally, I desperately don't want to lead her on in any way, but I also don't want to lie and say either yes or no if I'm not sure. I care about her more than anything and want to be the best friend for her that I can be until I manage to make up my mind one way or the other. &#x200B; &#x200B; TLDR: AITA for being unsure of my feelings towards my closest friend, and in that uncertainty, stringing her along for something that might or might not happen? &#x200B; \\*Note: everything I've written she knows about and we've discussed extensively.

I live here without a contract and pay cash in hand monthly. It's an arrangement that has worked fine for us both so far. My door locks from the inside but not from the outside. I value my privacy and personal space a lot, so when I moved in I asked the landlord why the door didn't lock. He said it was for \"safety reasons\", and because there is a boiler access point in my room that would occasionally need to be checked by a repairman. I said ok, as long as people aren't coming in and out of my room and I'm notified about any planned repairs, that wouldn't be a problem. While I was out today I received a package. Usually when one of us receives a package, we leave it on the stand by the front door. Instead of doing that, my landlord took the package, went into my room and left it in there. I found it when I got home. A few minutes later when I went into the kitchen to cook my dinner, my landlord came home and said \"Did you find the parcel I left in your room?\" I said yes, but didn't say anything else. Then he started complaining about the fact that I'd taken off my duvet cover and mattress topper, and how he doesn't want me to do that because it'll ruin them. I said \"Yeah but I put a blanket down on the mattress while I took those off.\" He went on a rant about old tenants not properly taking care of his house and things and told me again to put the covers back on. I'd taken them off to wash them, but I didn't say anything and he retired to the living room. I got angrier and angrier at the thought that he'd not only gone into my room, he'd also stayed there long enough to look around and realize I'd taken my bed linen off. I decided to confront him: \"We don't have a written contract but we have a verbal agreement. I pay you monthly for ownership of that room. You infringed on my privacy by entering a room I pay for. Please don't go into my room again, and if you absolutely have to, please give me notice in advance.\" He said \"I didn't go in there to snoop around. I leave my own bedroom door wide open. Past tenants have made a mess of my house and hoarded kitchen utensils in their rooms. I have to check your rooms to make sure that never happens again.\" But I've always kept my room in a good condition, I've never stolen any of his kitchen things, I haven't stained any carpets or broken anything in my room or elsewhere, and have never given him any reason to think I'm damaging his property. AITA for telling him to stay out of my room because its mine while I pay rent for it, even though he owns the house and we have no contract?

She's a ''friend of a friend of a friend'' of my sister and we hit it off at a party but were friends for a while before we got together. Molly has quite a distinctive appearance/style. She always wears a huge amount of makeup even when she's just hanging out at home, wears high heels all the time etc. She's also had cosmetic surgery such as breast implants and lip fillers. She had all this before we met so it wasn't my influence. While I think she's beautiful, many people don't. She gets a lot of stares and comments in the street, particularly from people of the older generation but also from people our age and younger. Some of my female friends have called the amount of makeup she wears ''hideous'' and said that she looks ''scary''. Needless to say I've cut those people off. Even Molly's own sister refers to her as a ''barbie doll'' A lot of people assume that Molly is deeply insecure which is why she covers herself in makeup and had the cosmetics but that's not true at all. It's just her personal style. When we first started chatting she was perfectly happy to send me bare faced selfies without any kind of prompting from me. Personally I think she is gorgeous with or without her makeup, but since being with her I found an undiscovered kink of sorts; The idea that I'm the only person who gets to see Molly's bare face feels super special and intimate, like she's saving a part of herself just for me. I've never had any reason to discourage her wearing makeup. She loves wearing it, and I love her wearing it (and not wearing it just as much!) A lot of people assume Molly is some shallow dumb ''bimbo'' but she really isn't. She is a qualified lawyer working for a big practice and makes 3x as much money as I do (and my earnings are themselves above average) I had a bit of a row with Molly's mother and sister yesterday, when she was sad about how ''insecure'' her sister was, and then rounded on me saying I need to make an effort to encourage her to go makeup free more often, wear flat shoes etc because she's ''obviously unhappy''. She thinks that I ''encourage'' Molly to do these things simply because I always tell her she's beautiful. If she suddenly decided to never wear heels or makeup again I really wouldn't care, because it was Molly the person that I fell in love with, the way she giggles, smiles, the way her face lights up when talking about something big at work.

I don\u0092t see myself as a Juggalette or anything. I am the opposite of a stereotypical Juggalo/Juggalette. I\u0092ve been dating my girlfriend for about a year now. We moved in together about 4 months ago. I like laying on my bed and playing music on my phone without headphones. Not at full blast, just to where I can hear it. I only do this when my girlfriend is gone or in another room. The first time I did this, she was in the room next to the one I was in. I was playing ICP songs. After about 15 minutes, she asked me to either turn it down or find something else to listen to. I turned the volume down and then played other music (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, etc). Later she told me she was uncomfortable hearing the music as she didn\u0092t like the lyrics. I completely understood and was not upset at all. The next day, she was in another room and I was alone in our room. I decided to listen to some music, ICP. I had the volume almost all the way down, so I could just barely hear it.

Fast forward to two months ago and we are out on the town partying and having a good time while shes down for a long weekend with him. Everything is fine until we all sit down at the first pub and he cant sit next to her because our friend is, he starts pouting like a toddler and puts on this whiny voice about how \"they haven't been able to be together since being down here\" and \"it's not fair he cant sit next to her\" (which is bullshit as they shared a bed at my parents) she just rolls her eyes and tells him to sit next to me as he walks off to order the drinks. While hes gone she turns to me after seeing the look of disbelief on my face and says she wants to talk to me about that tomorrow. Anyway the rest of the night goes well we are all laughing and having fun, until we end up at the club, we are all swapping between dancing and smoking when all of a sudden her bf is gone and my sister is crying, we all run over to her and she hugs my sobbing and explaining he stormed off after she wouldn't apologise for \"not looking at him enough while dancing\" accusing her of \"looking at other guys\" (we are in a gay bar filled with women 90% for reference to how stupid that is), I tell her he is being stupid and to not worry and enjoy the night without him, but this makes things worse and she breaks down admitting hes mentally abusive and that she cant handle it anymore and pulls out a list of stuff he does on a daily basis. At this point her phone is ringing non stop from him and she give it to me so she can ignore it after ten minutes of non stop ringing I pick it up, tell him shes gone i have her phone and to meet me so i can give it to him. This is where i fucked up. When I saw him I lost my cool, I marched over too him, said something along the lines of \"who the fuck to you think you are to abuse my little sister? You abusive cunt\" allot of calling him names, I dont remember the exact exchange but it ended with me not allowing him to see her, and him storming off.

But, since this class is full of adults, things would be different! ...Right? Anyway, I was assigned to a group which I had to work with other two women. A & B. A is my age, 27, and B is much older than both of us, 36. The first group assignment was to interview social workers and their opinions on their job. Cool, easy peasy, except I had to do it in a language I am not a native of. This was 4 weeks ago. But I did it. I transcribed the interview. I did my part. Boom, done. So I emailed the other ladies my work and asked/told/reminded them to do their part as well. A agreed to it but B, oh, boy. B told me she didn't think it was important since she couldn't understand what we had to do. (A reminder: interviewing social workers about their work.) Thus, she saw no reason to do it. Alright. Cool. I told her she'd have to do it anyway. She didn't believe me. She complained about it even. A just agreed to do it without any issue.

B told me to read what I got. And the instructor just stood there dumbfounded. I said no. I told the instructor it's a group work and it's going to stay that way. I was not going to read whatever I had done on my own just to afloat us. A understood. B just glared at me. On the break, B confronted me about how selfish and inconsiderate I was towards the whole group. I reminded her that it's a group task, I did my part and I did my individual task already.

Both Allen and Alice are married. I stayed out of it because I personally thought that they\u0092re just more comfortable with each other since they come from the same home town, plus the things they do that my coworkers find suspect honestly seem harmless to me. We all used to be part of the same team, but last year our team was split into two, with Allen leading Team A and Alice leading team B which I and the Susans are part of. Allen and his team transferred to another floor, but he continued to be close to Alice. When one of his clients gifted him a weekend stay for his team at a resort the client owns, he invited Alice to go with them. Alice said that our team mates might feel hurt that she was invited and they were not, so Allen extended the invitation to our team as well. The Susans happily accepted and we all spent a fun weekend at the client\u0092s resort. When we got back to the office last Monday, the Susans were talking about Allen and Alice again, and the gossip was a lot worse. Apparently, some people saw some things happen during our stay at the resort. This made me angry because we had just been to a vacation thanks to Alice and Allen, and here are these people gossiping about them. I spoke up and told the Susans that if Allen and Alice were having an affair, then why would they do anything during a vacation with coworkers when they could just meet up somewhere without anyone knowing. I don\u0092t know what I was thinking, but before I went home I decided to talk to Alice and finally told her about the gossip about her and Allen. She looked surprised and saddened, but she thanked me and said she appreciates that I told her. On Tuesday I learned that she filed for a two week leave and will not be back until July. The Susans don\u0092t know what I told Alice and are talking about possible reasons for her leave.

Situation: In order to make us moving in together work, she got a part time job. We both contribute 100% of our finances. We are comfortable enough with the money we have to be able to have family vacations, run 2 decent cars, rent our house, never want for anything etc. She has always insisted on working part time since we moved in together, but has always complained about her job, regardless of what it is (through 3 different ones). After her first proper shift in this 3rd job, she complained louder than ever, almost in tears when talking about it. I told her to quit now and look for another job, it wasn't worth ruining her dissertation year over. Over this period of complaining, she kept repeating to me \"I'm not a lazy person, I don't want to not-work, it's just this job.\" and \"I used to work full time and be a single mother, I'm a hard worker\". She did, and she has offers of a couple of jobs now, but h has now started dragging her feet about getting started with these new jobs, as well as saying that she has been talking to some friends and that they think she shouldn't have to work, I should just be happy she is contributing her student finance to our outgoings.

Working part time and being at university is not impossible (her brother did it, my sister did it, one of my best friends worked full time while at Uni). That yes, we could get by without her wage, but things would be tighter and may impact our wedding/future plans.

We both probably weighed around 300lbs, and though our weight has fluctuated over the years we both currently sit at around 350lbs and 450lbs respectively, with her being the latter.

We have to make weekly assignments which will count to your final mark. These assignments are graded on your outcome, and whether you follow the style of the uni (4 spaces etc). These assignments have to be made in pairs. So i paired up with someone, and during the first assignment i got the problem to work, and he immidiately started to complain that it could be more efficient. Now enter 2-3 hours of more coding because our code had to be more efficient. (Efficiency is NOT in the rubric and wont be taken into account). Enter week 2, we went through this more smoothly, but this week we got the results and we made a small mistake, no biggy, we have an 8.5/10. He now wants to talk to the professor, and send emails (while our code just doesnt work). I said no and got kind of annoyed, people have better things to do you know. Enter week 4, we have to make something which prints the output of our program, im done after 15 mins (for which he was still reading the assignment and talking on facebook) and he looks at my code and says, \"it can be more efficient\". I say okay sure, but it works and we are not graded on efficiency. Anyways i give him 15 mins (i wanted to take a short break anyways) where he makes code on my laptop. After 15 minutes his code is still a mess which wont work, and i want to continue with the difficult part of the assignment. So i tell him we should take my code and just continue.

She has a 5 year old large breed dog who I like, but I'm really, really not a dog person. I'm not really an animal person in general, but definitely if I had to have a pet I'd want one that was way less maintenance. Still, she loves her dog, I love her, we're all cool. I'm not mean to the dog, I don't ignore the dog, I play with him sometimes, and I go with her to dog parks and that sort of thing occasionally as well. A few months ago, my girlfriend started talking about moving in together. I told her I would normally think now is a good time in our relationship for that, but that I wasn't really comfortable living with a dog at this time. She argued and said that she would take 100% responsibility and care of him. I thought it wasn't possible, but she assured me I wouldn't have to do a single thing I didn't want to. I thought it was a pretty bad idea, but I suggested a trial period where she stays with me, and if it works out by the time my lease is up, then we move into a bigger place together. She agreed wholeheartedly, and moved in. At first things were fine. But one week, she got pretty sick, so I took care of her dog that week. Then, she had to go out of town, and I took care of the dog then too though I mentioned to her in the future, she'd need to make other arrangements. Things like this kept cropping up. She needed to go to work early, her friend was in town and she wanted to go out. Sometimes I refused, but each time I did, she kicked up a fuss. I tried reminding her of our deal, but she said it was only sometimes and only for \"extenuating circumstances\" and it was ridiculous to expect her to pay money to watch her dog when I was at home. So I told her when my lease was up, I'll be renewing it on my own here, and that I didn't feel like the trial had gone well. She got very upset about that, and started to argue a lot about how she didn't expect NO help, just not a lot, and her dog will live for at least another 5 years, did I expect we'll never live with each other until then. I told her no but right now I value the freedom that I have not caring for another creature. I also said if it changed in either direction, I become more okay with it, or I realize I'll never be okay with it, I'd let her know immediately. She didn't like that either. Some of her friends have pulled the \"wHaT aBoUt WhEn yOu HaVe KiDs?\" but obviously my kids would be a totally different thing for me, and I've shut it down each time she's tried to argue that.

If you buy tickets in advance you get given a seat reservation, but if you buy them at the station you don\u0092t and you may have to stand if there\u0092s no seats available. I\u0092d booked a seat so I was all good. Usually when you get on the train there are little screens above each seat which say if they\u0092re reserved but they weren\u0092t working that day, and reservations still apply even if the signs are broken. Anyway, I\u0092m on the train and this couple who\u0092d been out shopping (had loads of bags from clothes shops) got on and sat down. A few mins later some people get on and politely ask this couple to move as they\u0092re sitting in their reserved seats. Usually people just accept this and get up and move because they know they haven\u0092t booked, but the guy from the couple asked to see this persons ticket to make sure it was actually their seat (wtf, who made you the ticket inspector) anyway, it was their seat and so reluctantly the couple move to some other free seats opposite myself and my partner. The train was filling up pretty quickly and I realised it was gonna be full, it was 5pm on a weekday so lots of commuters. A lady and her son come along, looking confused as there were people sitting in their reserved seats (this couple), they were clearly tourists so couldn\u0092t really speak english and weren\u0092t sure of the etiquette of how to ask for their seats. Eventually they realised that their seats were taken and so asked the couple to move, again this guy gets all rude like ffs, and asks to see their tickets. At this point everyone on the train is watching. The couple are complaining and swearing under their breath whilst getting up. The kid is just standing in the aisle looking awkward not really knowing what to do (standing a bit in the way of this guy but not massively) and then: HIM (rude guy to kid): are you gonna fucking move then so I can get up This kid is literally like 9 years old So I told the guy: you don\u0092t need to be so rude HIM: what did you just say to me ME: I said you didn\u0092t need to be so rude. He\u0092s only a child and you were in his seat anyway HIM: Oh for gods sake (walks off in a huff with his girlfriend) They left all their shopping bags under the table and to be honest, although we noticed we didn\u0092t say anything because he was being a dick. When I told all this to my friend later she said that even though they were being rude it was bad of us to not tell them that they left their bags.

I understand that not all parents are going to like my teaching style and that's okay with me. I've dealt with it before and it's not that big of a deal anymore. Anyway, I have had a recent problem with my students coming in costumes the past few weeks. I'm not trying to be a party pooper (we have a very full dramatic play center with costumes that I rotate weekly/bi-weekly with the center theme changes). The kids fight over the costumes they're difficult when it comes to bathroom time, and the kids that come in costume are always wary of getting messy (not wanting to participate in art/sensory experiences). It's been a problem with a little over half of my class, but ESPECIALLY with one girl \\[5f\\] (I'll call her Sally). I've had multiple, specific talks with her parents before about not sending her in costume, but they seem to forget after a few days. Today, Sally came fully in costume from tiara down to heels. I gently reminded her mom when she dropped her off that, although she looked cute, costumes were not allowed in class unless it was a spirit day and I would have to have her change into her extra clothes to continue the day. She just rolled her eyes and left. I talked to my school director and she said just to remind parents of my classroom policy, so I sent out an email to all my parents that said: \"Good afternoon, parents! Just a reminder: costumes are not allowed in class! Aside from being a distraction to the learning process, they pose a potential safety risk to your children. Please remember that your children's day to day activities consist of moving around and (occasionally) getting messy, so keep that in mind when dressing your child! Any concerns may be addressed to myself or \\[school director\\]. Thank you!\" This afternoon, Sally's mom came to pick her up and screamed at me for singling her child out in my email and trying to police what her daughter wore. She said I was ruining her self confidence and that she seriously questioned my understanding of children by forbidding her daughter's \"self-expression\". She also was very upset that I didn't talk to her personally about Sally's outfit, but, like I said, I tried to this morning and I also have had this conversation with her at least 4 times since December (plus she's not the only parent I've had to tell). I understand that sometimes kids fight to wear a certain thing in the morning and parents just give in because it's not worth it the argument, but I feel like I have to draw the line somewhere.

She then proceeds to ask for money, standard beggar routine to which I almost never carry cash, let alone any change and told her I had none. Now, I wear a suit daily, I get paid well, but I have 2 kids at home so I don't throw money around. But if I can, I will buy a homeless person something to eat or drink.
