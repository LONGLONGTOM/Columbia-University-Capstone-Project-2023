I know the wedding is really more her day than mine because she\\x92s been focused on the ceremony of it all for a lot longer, so after back and forth we agreed she could set the budget for the wedding but we couldn\\x92t go into debt for it (yes, she was really considering this. The wedding has really pulled the wool over her usually very fiscally responsible eyes.) We ended up deciding on a budget that was larger than what I was comfortable with, but with the caveat that she would allocate half and I would allocate the other half. After going to a bunch of cake tasting and looking at many venues, I decided to put 20% of my portion of the budget towards her dream dress about 80% of my half towards buying us a house. She is insisting I spend it on the wedding. I am resolute that this is, in the long run, what will actually make us both happiest. Her parents are relieved I\\x92m doing this. They hate the neighborhood we live in. But tonight my mom said \\x93you\\x92re being an asshole\\x94 and it made me realize I should post specifically to here.
